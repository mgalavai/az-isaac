     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>It was a very old book. Margie's grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper.</span>

And then, when they turned back to the page before, it had the same words on it that it had had when they read it the first time.</span>

     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"Gee," said Tommy, "what a waste. When you're through with the book, you just throw it away, I guess. Our television screen must have had a million books on it and it's good for plenty more. I wouldn't throw it away."</span>

     <span class="GramE">school</span>? I hate school." Margie always hated school, but now she hated it-more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the </span>

     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>He was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled at her and gave her an apple, then took the teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn't know how to put it together again, but he knew how all right and, after an hour or so, there it was again, large and black and ugly with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked. That wasn't so bad. The part she hated most was the slot where she had to put homework and test papers. She always had to write them out in a punch code they made her learn when she was six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated the mark in no time.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>The inspector had smiled after he was finished and patted her head. He said to her mother, "It's not the little girl's fault, Mrs. Jones. I think the geography sector was geared a little too <span class="GramE">quick</span>. Those things happen sometimes. I've slowed it up to an average ten-year level. Actually, the over-all pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory." And he patted Margie's head again.</span>

    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Margie was disappointed. She had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether. They had once taken Tommy's teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely.</span>

   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>So she said to Tommy, "Why would anyone write about school?"</span>

   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes. <span class="GramE">"Because it's not our kind of school, stupid.</span> This is the old kind of school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago." He added loftily, pronouncing the word carefully, "Centuries ago."</span>

     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Margie was hurt. "Well, I don't know what kind of school they had all that time ago." She read the book over his shoulder for a while, <span class="GramE">then</span> said, "Anyway, they had a teacher."</span>

     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"Sure they had a teacher, but it wasn't a regular teacher. It was a man."</span>

   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Well, he just told the boys and girls things and gave them homework and asked them questions."</span>

   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"A man isn't smart enough."</span>

     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"Sure he is. My father knows as much as my teacher."</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"He can't. A man can't know as much as a teacher."</span>

    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">

     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Margie wasn't prepared to dispute that. She said, "I wouldn't want a strange man in my house to teach me."</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Tommy screamed with laughter, "You don't know much, Margie. The teachers didn't live in the house. They had a special building and all the kids went there."</span>
   </p>

    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"And all the kids learned the same thing?"</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"Sure, if they were the same age."</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"But my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that each kid has to be taught differently."</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"Just the same, they didn't do it that way then. If you don't like it, you don't have to read the book."</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"I didn't say I didn't like it," Margie said quickly. She wanted to read about those funny schools.</span>

   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>They weren't even half finished when Margie's mother called, "Margie! <span class="GramE">School!"</span></span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Margie looked up. <span class="GramE">"Not yet, mamma."</span></span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"Now," said Mrs. Jones. "And it's probably time for Tommy, too."</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Margie said to Tommy, "Can I read the book some more with you after school?"</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>"Maybe," he said, nonchalantly. He walked away whistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath his arm.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Margie went into the schoolroom. It was right next to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her. It was always on at the same time every day except Saturday and Sunday, because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>The screen was lit up, and it said: "Today's arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions. Please insert yesterday's homework in the proper slot."</span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoPlainText">
    <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"">
     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather's grandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom, going home together at the end of the day. They learned the same things so they could help one another on the homework and talk about it.</span>

     <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>And the teachers were <span class="GramE">people ....</span></span>
