<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George Platen could not conceal the longing in
his voice. It was too much to suppress. He said, &quot;Tomorrow's the first of
May. Olympics!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He rolled over on his
stomach and peered over the foot of his bed at his roommate. Didn't he feel it,
too? Didn't <i>this </i>make some impression on him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George's face was thin
and had grown a trifle thinner in the nearly year and a half that he had been
at the House. His figure was slight but the look in his blue eyes was as
intense as it had ever been, and right now there was a trapped look in the way
his fingers curled against the bedspread.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George's roommate
looked up briefly from his book and took the opportunity to adjust the
light-level of the stretch of wall near his chair. His name was Hali Omani and
he was a Nigerian by birth. His dark brown skin and massive features seemed
made for calmness, and mention of the Olympics did not move him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;I know,
George.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George owed much to
Hali's patience and kindness when it was needed, but even patience and kindness
could be overdone. Was this a time to sit there like a statue built of some
dark, warm wood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George wondered if he
himself would grow like that after ten years here and rejected the thought
violently. No!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said defiantly,
&quot;I think you've forgotten what May means.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The other said,
&quot;I remember very well what it means. It means nothing! You're the one
who's forgotten that. May means nothing to you, George Platen, and,&quot; he
added softly, &quot;it means nothing to me, Hali Omani.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said, &quot;The
ships are coming in for recruits. By June, thousands and thousands will leave
with millions of men and women heading for any world you can name, and all that
means nothing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Less than
nothing. What do you want me to do about it, anyway?&quot; Omani ran his finger
along a difficult passage in the book he was reading and his lips moved
soundlessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George watched him.
Damn it, he thought, yell, scream; you can do that much. Kick at me, do
anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was only that he
wanted not to be so alone in his anger. He wanted not to be the only one so
filled with resentment, not to be the only one dying a slow death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was better those
first weeks when the Universe was a small shell of vague light and sound
pressing down upon him. It was better before Omani had wavered into view and
dragged him back to a life that wasn't worth living.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani! He was old! He
was at least thirty. George thought: Will I be like that at thirty? Will I be
like that in twelve years?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And because he was
afraid he might be, he yelled at Omani, &quot;Will you stop reading that fool
book?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani turned a page
and read on a few words, then lifted his head with its skullcap of crisply
curled hair and said, &quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What good does
it do you to read the book?&quot; He stepped forward, snorted &quot;More
electronics,&quot; and slapped it out of Omani's hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani got up slowly
and picked up the book. He smoothed a crumpled page without visible rancor.
&quot;Call it the satisfaction of curiosity,&quot; he said. &quot;I understand
a little of it today, perhaps a little more tomorrow. That's a victory in a
way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A victory. What
kind of a victory? Is that what satisfies you in life? To get to know enough to
be a quarter of a Registered Electronician by the time you're sixty-five?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Perhaps by the
time I'm thirty-five.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And then who'll
want you? Who'll use you? Where will you go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No one. No one.
Nowhere. I'll stay here and read other books.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And that
satisfies you? Tell me! You've dragged me to class. You've got me to reading
and memorizing, too. For what? There's nothing in it that satisfies me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What good will
it do you to deny yourself satisfaction?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It means I'll
quit the whole farce. I’ll do as I planned to do in the beginning before you
dovey-lovied me out of it. I'm going to force them to—to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani put down his
book. He let the other run down and then said, 'To what, George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;To correct a
miscarriage of justice. A frame-up. I'll get that Antonelli and force him to
admit he—he—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani shook his head.
&quot;Everyone who comes here insists it's a mistake. I thought you'd passed
that stage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't call it a
stage,&quot; said George violently. &quot;In my case, it's a fact. I've told
you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You've told me,
but in your heart you know no one made any mistake as far as you were
concerned.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Because no one
will admit it? You think any of them would admit a mistake unless they were
forced to?—Well, I'll force them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was May that was
doing this to George; it was Olympics month. He felt it bring the old wildness
back and he couldn't stop it. He didn't want to stop it. He had been in danger
of forgetting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;I was
going to be a Computer Programmer and I <i>can </i>be one. I could be one
today, regardless of what they say analysis shows.&quot; He pounded his mattress.
&quot;They're wrong. They <i>must </i>be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The analysts are
never wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;They <i>must </i>be.
Do you doubt my intelligence?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Intelligence
hasn't one thing to do with it. Haven't you been told that often enough? Can't
you understand that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George rolled away,
lay on his back, and stared somberly at the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What did you
want to be, Hali?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I had no fixed
plans. Hydroponicist would have suited me, I suppose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Did you think
you could make it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I wasn't
sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George had never asked
personal questions of Omani before. It struck him as queer, almost unnatural,
that other people had had ambitions and ended here. Hydroponicist!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Did you
think you'd make <i>this?&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, but here I
am just the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you're
satisfied. Really, really satisfied. You're happy. You love it. You wouldn't be
anywhere else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Slowly, Omani got to
his feet. Carefully, he began to unmake his bed. He said, &quot;George, you're
a hard case. You're knocking yourself out because you won't accept the facts
about yourself. George, you're here in what you call the House, but I've never
heard you give it its full title. Say it, George, say it. Then go to bed and
sleep this off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George gritted his
teeth and showed them. He chocked out, &quot;No!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then I
will,&quot; said Omani, and he did. He shaped each syllable carefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George was bitterly
ashamed at the sound of it. He turned his head away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For most of the first
eighteen years of his life, George Platen had headed firmly in one direction,
that of Registered Computer Programmer. There were those in his crowd who spoke
wisely of Spationautics, Refrigeration Technology, Transportation Control, and
even Administration. But George held firm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He argued relative
merits as vigorously as any of them, and why not? Education Day loomed ahead of
them and was the great fact of their existence. It approached steadily, as
fixed and certain as the calendar—the first day of November of the year
following one's eighteenth birthday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>After that day, there
were other topics of conversation. One could discuss with others some detail of
the profession, or the virtues of one's wife and children, or the fate of one's
space-polo team, or one's experiences in the Education Day, however, there was
only one topic that unfailingly and unwearyingly held everyone's interest, and
that was Education Day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What are you
going for? Think you'll make it? Heck, that's no good. Look at the records;
quota's been cut. Logistics now—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Or Hypermechanics now—Or
Communications now—Or Gravities now—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Especially Gravities
at the moment. Everyone had been talking about Gravities in the few years just
before George's Education Day because of the development of the Gravitic power
engine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Any world within ten
light-years of a dwarf star, everyone said, would give its eyeteeth for any
kind of Registered Gravities Engineer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The thought of that
never bothered George. Sure it would; all the eyeteeth it could scare up. But
George had also heard what had happened before in a newly developed technique.
Rationalization and simplification followed in a flood. New models each year;
new types of gravitic engines; new principles. Then all those eyeteeth
gentlemen would find themselves out of date and superseded by later models with
later educations. The first group would then have to settle down to unskilled
labor or ship out to some backwoods world that wasn't quite caught up yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Now Computer
Programmers were in steady demand year after year, century after century. The
demand never reached wild peaks; there was never a howling bull market for
Programmers; but the demand climbed steadily as new worlds opened up and as
older words grew more complex.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He had argued with
Stubby Trevelyan about that constantly. As best friends, their arguments had to
be constant and vitriolic and, of course, neither ever persuaded or was
persuaded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But then Trevelyan had
had a father who was a Registered Metallurgist and had actually served on one
of the Outworlds, and a grandfather who had also been a Registered
Metallurgist. He himself was intent on becoming a Registered Metallurgist
almost as a matter of family right and was firmly convinced that any other
profession was a shade less than respectable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;There'll always
be metal,&quot; he said,  &quot;and there's  an accomplishment in molding
alloys to specification and watching structures grow. Now what's a Programmer
going to be doing. Sitting at a coder all day long, feeding some fool mile-long
machine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Even at sixteen,
George had learned to be practical. He said simply, &quot;There'll be a million
Metallurgists put out along with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Because it's
good. A good profession. The best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But you get
crowded out, Stubby. You can be way back in line. Any world can tape out its
own Metallurgists, and the market for advanced Earth models isn't so big. And
it's mostly the small worlds that want them. You know what per cent of the
turn-out of Registered Metallurgists get tabbed for worlds with a Grade A
rating. I looked it up. It's just 13.3 per cent. That means you'll have seven
chances in eight of being stuck in some world that just about has running
water. You may even be stuck on Earth; 2.3 per cent are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan said
belligerently, &quot;There's no disgrace in staying on Earth. Earth needs
technicians, too. Good ones.&quot; His grandfather had been an Earth-bound
Metallurgist, and Trevelyan lifted his finger to his upper lip and dabbed at an
as yet nonexistent mustache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George knew about
Trevelyan's grandfather and, considering the Earth-bound position of his own
ancestry, was in no mood to sneer. He said diplomatically, &quot;No
intellectual disgrace. Of course not. But it's nice to get into a Grade A
world, isn't it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now you take
Programmers. Only the Grade A worlds have the kind of computers that really
need first-class Programmers so they're the only ones in the market. And
Programmer tapes are complicated and hardly any one fits. They need more
Programmers than their own population can supply. It's just a matter of
statistics. There's one first-class Programmer per million, say. A world needs
twenty and has a population of ten million, they have to come to Earth for five
to fifteen Programmers. Right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you know how
many Registered Computer Programmers went to Grade A planets last year? I'll
tell you. Every last one. If you're a Programmer, you're a picked man. Yes,
sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan frowned. &quot;If
only one in a million makes it, what makes you think <i>you'll </i>make
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said guardedly,
&quot;I'll make it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He never dared tell
anyone; not Trevelyan; not his parents; of exactly what he was doing that made
him so confident. But he wasn't worried. He was simply confident (that was the
worst of the memories he had in the hopeless days afterward). He was as blandly
confident as the average eight-year-old kid approaching Reading Day— that
childhood preview of Education Day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Of course, Reading Day
had been different. Partly, there was the simple fact of childhood. A boy of
eight takes many extraordinary things in stride. One day you can't read and the
next day you can. That's just the way things are. Like the sun shining.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And then not so much
depended upon it. There were no recruiters just ahead, waiting and jostling for
the lists and scores on the coming Olympics. A boy or girl who goes through the
Reading Day is just someone who has ten more years of undifferentiated living
upon Earth's crawling surface; just someone who returns to his family with one
new ability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>By the time Education
Day came, ten years later, George wasn't even sure of most of the details of
his own Reading Day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Most clearly of all,
he remembered it to be a dismal September day with a mild rain falling.
(September for Reading Day; November for Education Day; May for Olympics. They
made nursery rhymes out of it.) George had dressed by the wall lights, with his
parents far more excited than he himself was. His father was a Registered Pipe
Fitter and had found his occupation on Earth. This fact had always been a
humiliation to him, although, of course, as anyone could see plainly, most of
each generation must stay on Earth in the nature of things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There had to be
farmers and miners and even technicians on Earth. It was only the late-model,
high-specialty professions that were in demand on the Outworlds, and only a few
millions a year out of Earth's eight billion population could be exported.
Every man and woman on Earth couldn't be among that group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But every man and
woman could hope that at least one of his children could be one, and Platen,
Senior, was certainly no exception. It was obvious to him (and, to be sure, to
others as well) that George was notably intelligent and quick-minded. He would
be bound to do well and he would have to, as he was an only child. If George
didn't end on an Outworld, they would have to wait for grandchildren before a
next chance would come along, and that was too far in the future to be much
consolation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Reading Day would not
prove much, of course, but it would be the only indication they would have
before the big day itself. Every parent on Earth would be listening to the
quality of reading when his child came home with it; listening for any
particularly easy flow of words and building that into certain omens of the
future. There were few families that didn't have at least one hopeful who, from
Reading Day on, was the great hope because of the way he handled his
trisyllabics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dimly, George was
aware of the cause of his parents' tension, and if there was any anxiety in his
young heart that drizzly morning, it was only the fear that his father's
hopeful expression might fade out when he returned home with his reading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The children met in
the large assembly room of the town's Education hall. All over Earth, in
millions of local halls, throughout that month, similar groups of children
would be meeting. George felt depressed by the grayness of the room and by the
other children, strained and stiff in unaccustomed finery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Automatically, George
did as all the rest of the children did. He found the small clique that
represented the children on his floor of the apartment house and joined them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan, who lived
immediately next door, still wore his hair childishly long and was years
removed from the sideburns and thin, reddish mustache that he was to grow as
soon as he was physiologically capable of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan (to whom
George was then known as Jaw-jee) said, &quot;Bet you're scared.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I am not,&quot;
said George. Then, confidentially, &quot;My folks got a hunk of printing up on
the dresser in my room, and when I come home, I'm going to read it for
them.&quot; (George's main suffering at the moment lay in the fact that he
didn't quite know where to put his hands. He had been warned not to scratch his
head or rub his ears or pick his nose or put his hands into his pockets. This
eliminated almost every possibility.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan put <i>his </i>hands
in his pockets and said, &quot;My father isn't worried.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan, Senior, had
been a Metallurgist on Diporia for nearly seven years, which gave him a
superior social status in his neighborhood even though he had retired and
returned to Earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Earth discouraged
these re-immigrants because of population problems, but a small trickle did
return. For one thing the cost of living was lower on Earth, and what was a
trifling annuity on Diporia, say, was a comfortable income on Earth. Besides,
there were always men who found more satisfaction in displaying their success
before the friends and scenes of their childhood than before all the rest of
the Universe besides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan, Senior,
further explained that if he stayed on Diporia, so would his children, and
Diporia was a one-spaceship world. Back on Earth, his kids could end anywhere,
even Novia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Stubby Trevelyan had
picked up that item early. Even before Reading Day, his conversation was based
on the carelessly assumed fact that his ultimate home would be in Novia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George, oppressed by
thoughts of the other's future greatness and his own small-time contrast, was
driven to belligerent defense at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;My father isn't
worried either. He just wants to hear me read because he knows I’ll be good. I
suppose your father would just as soon not hear you because he knows you'll be
all wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I will not be
all wrong. Reading is <i>nothing. </i>On Novia, I'll <i>hire </i>people to read
to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Because <i>you </i>won't
be able to read yourself, on account of you're <i>dumb!&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then how come
I'll be on Novia?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And George, driven,
made the great denial, &quot;Who says you'll be on Novia? Bet you don't go
anywhere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Stubby Trevelyan
reddened. &quot;I won't be a Pipe Fitter like your old man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Take that back,
you dumbhead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You take <i>that
</i>back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They stood nose to
nose, not wanting to fight but relieved at having something familiar to do in
this strange place. Furthermore, now that George had curled his hands into
fists and lifted them before his face, the problem of what to do with his hands
was, at least temporarily, solved. Other children gathered round excitedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But then it all ended
when a woman's voice sounded loudly over the public address system. There was
instant silence everywhere. George dropped his fists and forgot Trevelyan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Children,&quot;
said the voice, &quot;we are going to call out your names. As each child is
called, he or she is to go to one of the men waiting along the side walls. Do
you see them? They are wearing red uniforms so they will be easy to find. The
girls will go to the right. The boys will go to the left. Now look about and
see which man in red is nearest to you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George found his man
at a glance and waited for his name to be called off. He had not been
introduced before this to the sophistications of the alphabet, and the length
of time it took to reach his own name grew disturbing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The crowd of children
thinned; little rivulets made their way to each of the red-clad guides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>When the name
&quot;George Platen&quot; was finally called, his sense of relief was exceeded
only by the feeling of pure gladness at the fact that Stubby Trevelyan still
stood in his place, uncalled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George shouted back
over his shoulder as he left, &quot;Yay, Stubby, maybe they don't want
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That moment of gaiety
quickly left. He was herded into a line and directed down corridors in the
company of strange children. They all looked at one another, large-eyed and
concerned, but beyond a snuffling, &quot;Quitcher pushing&quot; and &quot;Hey,
watch out&quot; there was no conversation. They were handed little slips of
paper which they were told must remain with them. George stared at his
curiously. Little black marks of different shapes. He knew it to be printing
but how could anyone make words out of it? He couldn't imagine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was told to strip;
he and four other boys who were all that now remained together. All the new
clothes came shucking off and four eight-year-olds stood naked and small,
shivering more out of embarrassment than cold. Medical technicians came past,
probing them, testing them with odd instruments, pricking them for blood. Each
took the little cards and made additional marks on them with little black rods
that produced the marks, all neatly lined up, with great speed. George stared
at the new marks, but they were no more comprehensible than the old. The
children were ordered back into their clothes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They sat on separate
little chairs then and waited again. Names were called again and &quot;George
Platen&quot; came third.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He moved into a large
room, filled with frightening instruments with knobs and glassy panels in
front. There was a desk in the very center, and behind it a man sat, his eyes
on the papers piled before him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;George
Platen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot;
said George, in a shaky whisper. All this waiting and all this going here and
there was making him<u> </u>nervous. He wished it were over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The man behind the
desk said, &quot;I am Dr. Lloyd, George. How are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor didn't look
up as he spoke. It was as though he had said those words over and over again
and didn't have to look up any more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm all
right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you afraid,
George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;N—no, sir,&quot;
said George, sounding afraid even in his own ears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's good,&quot;
said the doctor, &quot;because there's nothing to be afraid of, you know. Let's
see, George. It says here on your card that your father is named Peter and that
he's a Registered Pipe Fitter and your mother is named Amy and is a Registered
Home Technician. Is that right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Y—yes,
sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And your
birthday is February 13, and you had an ear infection about a year ago.
Right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you know how
I know all these things?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's on the
card, I think, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's
right.&quot; The doctor looked up at George for the first time and smiled. He
showed even teeth and looked much younger than George's father. Some of
George's nervousness vanished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor passed the
card to George. &quot;Do you know what all those things there mean,
George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Although George knew
he did not he was startled by the sudden request into looking at the card as
though he might understand now through some sudden stroke of fate. But they
were just marks as before and he passed the card back. &quot;No, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George felt a sudden
pang of suspicion concerning the sanity of this doctor. Didn't he know why not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said, &quot;I
can't read, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Would you like
to read?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why,
George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George stared, appalled.
No one had ever asked  him that. He had no answer. He said falteringly, &quot;I
don't know, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Printed
information will direct you all through your life. There is so much you'll have
to know even after Education Day. Cards like this one will tell you. Books will
tell you. Television screens will tell you. Printing will tell you such useful
things and such interesting things that not being able to read would be as bad
as not being able to see. Do you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you afraid,
George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Good. Now I'll
tell you exactly what we'll do first. I'm going to put these wires on your
forehead just over the corners of your eyes. They'll stick there but they won't
hurt at all. Then, I'll turn on something that will make a buzz. It will sound
funny and it may tickle you, but it won't hurt. Now if it does hurt, you tell me,
and I'll turn it off right away, but it won't hurt. All right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George nodded and
swallowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you
ready?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George nodded. He
closed his eyes while the doctor busied himself. His parents had explained this
to him. They, too, had said it wouldn't hurt, but then there were always the
older children. There were the ten- and twelve-year-olds who howled after the
eight-year-olds waiting for Reading Day, &quot;Watch out for the needle.&quot;
There were the others who took you off in confidence and said, &quot;They got
to cut your head open. They use a sharp knife that big with a hook on it,&quot;
and so on into horrifying details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George had never
believed them but he had had nightmares, and now he closed his eyes and felt
pure terror.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He didn't feel the
wires at his temple. The buzz was a distant thing, and there was the sound of
his own blood in his ears, ringing hollowly as though it and he were in a large
cave. Slowly he chanced opening his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor had his
back to him. From one of the instruments a strip of paper unwound and was
covered with a thin, wavy purple line. The doctor tore off pieces and put them
into a slot in another machine. He did it over and over again. Each time a
little piece of film came out, which the doctor looked at. Finally, he turned
toward George with a queer frown between his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The buzzing stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said
breathlessly, &quot;Is it over?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor said,
&quot;Yes,&quot; but he was still frowning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Can I read
now?&quot; asked George. He felt no different.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor said,
&quot;What?&quot; then smiled very suddenly and briefly. He said, &quot;It
works fine, George. You'll be reading in fifteen minutes. Now we're going to
use another machine this time and it will take longer. I'm going to cover your
whole head, and when I turn it on you won't be able to see or hear anything for
a while, but it won't hurt. Just to make sure I'm going to give you a little
switch to hold in your hand. If anything hurts, you press the little button and
everything shuts off. All right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In later years, George
was told that the little switch was strictly a dummy; that it was introduced
solely for confidence. He never did know for sure, however, since he never
pushed the button.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A large smoothly
curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed over his head and left
there. Three or four little knobs seemed to grab at him and bite into his
skull, but there was only a little pressure that faded. No pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor's voice
sounded dimly. &quot;Everything all right, George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And then, with no real
warning, a layer of thick felt closed down all about him. He was disembodied,
there was no sensation, no universe, only himself and a distant murmur at the
very ends of nothingness telling him something—telling him—telling him—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He strained to hear
and understand but there was all that thick felt between.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then the helmet was
taken off his head, and the light was so bright that it hurt his eyes while the
doctor's voice drummed at his ears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor said,
&quot;Here's your card, George. What does it say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George looked at his
card again and gave out a strangled shout. The marks weren't just marks at all.
They made up words. They were words just as clearly as though something were
whispering them in his ears. He could <i>hear </i>them being whispered as he
looked at them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What does it
say, George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It says—it
says—'Platen, George. Born 13 February 6492 of Peter and Amy Platen in
...'&quot; He broke off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You can read,
George,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;It's all over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;For good? I
won't forget how?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course
not.&quot; The doctor leaned over to shake hands gravely. &quot;You will be
taken home now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was days before
George got over this new and great talent of his. He read, for his father with
such facility that Platen, Senior, wept and called relatives to tell the good
news.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George walked about
town, reading every scrap of printing he could find and wondering how it was
that none of it had ever made sense to him before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He tried to remember
how it was not to be able to read and he couldn't. As far as his feeling about
it was concerned, he had always been able to read. Always.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>At eighteen, George
was rather dark, of medium height, but thin enough to look taller. Trevelyan,
who was scarcely an inch shorter, had a stockiness of build that made
&quot;Stubby&quot; more than ever appropriate, but in this last year he had
grown self-conscious. The nickname could no longer be used without reprisal.
And since Trevelyan disapproved of his proper first name even more strongly, he
was called Trevelyan or any decent variant of that. As though to prove his
manhood further, he had most persistently grown a pair of sideburns and a
bristly mustache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was sweating and
nervous now, and George, who had himself grown out of &quot;Jaw-jee&quot; and
into the curt monosyllabic gutturability of &quot;George,&quot; was rather
amused by that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were in the same
large hall they had been in ten years before (and not since). It was as if a
vague dream of the past had come to sudden reality. In the first few minutes
George had been distinctly surprised at finding everything seem smaller and
more cramped than his memory told him; then he made allowance for his own
growth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The crowd was smaller
than it had been in childhood. It was exclusively male this time. The girls had
another day assigned them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan leaned over
to say, &quot;Beats me the way they make you wait.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Red tape,&quot;
said George. &quot;You can't avoid it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan said,
&quot;What makes <i>you </i>so damned tolerant about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I've got nothing
to worry about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, brother, you
make me sick. I hope you end up Registered Manure Spreader just so I can see
your face when you do.&quot; His somber eyes swept the crowd anxiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George looked about,
too. It wasn't quite the system they used on the children. Matters went slower,
and instructions had been given out at the start in print (an advantage over
the pre-Readers). The names Platen and Trevelyan were well down the alphabet
still, but this time the two knew it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Young men came out of
the education rooms, frowning and uncomfortable, picked up their clothes and
belongings, then went oft to analysis to learn the results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Each, as he come out,
would be surrounded by a clot of the thinning crowd. &quot;How was it?&quot;
&quot;How'd it feel?&quot; &quot;Whacha think ya made?&quot; &quot;Ya feel any
different?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Answers were vague and
noncommittal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George forced himself
to remain out of those clots. You only raised your own blood pressure. Everyone
said you stood the best chance if you remained calm. Even so, you could feel
the palms of your hands grow cold. Funny that new tensions came with the years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For instance,
high-specialty professionals heading out for an Outworld were accompanied by a
wife (or husband). It was important to keep the sex ratio in good balance on
all worlds. And if you were going out to a Grade A world, what girl would
refuse you? George had no specific girl in mind yet; he wanted none. Not now!
Once he made Programmer; once he could add to his name, Registered Computer
Programmer, he could take his pick, like a sultan in a harem. The thought
excited him and he tried to put it away. Must stay calm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan muttered,
&quot;What's it all about anyway? First they say it works best if you're
relaxed and at ease. Then they put you through this and make it impossible for
you to be relaxed and at ease.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Maybe that's the
idea. They're separating the boys from the men to begin with. Take it easy,
Trev.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Shut up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George's turn came.
His name was not called. It appeared in glowing letters on the notice board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He waved at Trevelyan.
&quot;Take it easy. Don't let it get you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was happy as he
entered the testing chamber. Actually happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The man behind the
desk said, &quot;George Platen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For a fleeting instant
there was a razor-sharp picture in George's mind of another man, ten years
earlier, who had asked the same question, and it was almost as though this were
the same man and he, George, had turned eight again as he had stepped across
the threshold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But the man looked up
and, of course, the face matched that of the sudden memory not at all. The nose
was bulbous, the hair thin and stringy, and the chin wattled as though its
owner had once been grossly overweight and had reduced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The man behind the
desk looked annoyed. &quot;Well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George came to Earth.
&quot;I'm George Platen, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Say so, then.
I'm Dr. Zachary Antonelli, and we're going to be intimately acquainted in a
moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stared at small
strips of film, holding them up to the light owlishly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George winced
inwardly. Very hazily, he remembered that other doctor (he had forgotten the
name) staring at such film. Could these be the same? The other doctor had
frowned and this one was looking at him now as though he were angry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>His happiness was
already just about gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Antonelli spread
the pages of a thickish file out before him now and put the films carefully to
one side. &quot;It says here you want to be a Computer Programmer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes,
doctor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Still
do?&quot;     .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's a
responsible and exacting position. Do you feel up to it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Most
pre-Educates don't put down any specific profession. I believe they are afraid
of queering it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I think that's
right, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Aren't you
afraid of that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I might as well
be honest, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Antonelli nodded,
but without any noticeable lightening of his expression. &quot;Why do you want
to be a Programmer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's a
responsible and exacting position as you said, sir. It's an important job and
an exciting one. I like it and I think I can do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Antonelli put the
papers away, and looked at George sourly. He said, &quot;How do you know you
like it? Because you think you'll be snapped up by some Grade A planet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George thought
uneasily: He's trying to rattle you. Stay calm and stay frank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;I think
a Programmer has a good chance, sir, but even if I were left on Earth, I know
I'd like it.&quot; (That was true enough. I'm not lying, thought George.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right, how
do you know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He asked it as though
he knew there was no decent answer and George almost smiled. He had one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;I've
been reading about Programming, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You've been <i>what?&quot;
</i>Now the doctor looked genuinely astonished and George took pleasure in
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Reading about
it, sir. I bought a book on the subject and I've been studying it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A book for
Registered Programmers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But you couldn't
understand it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not at first. I
got other books on mathematics and electronics. I made out all I could. I still
don't know much, but I know enough to know I like it and to know I can make
it.&quot; (Even his parents never found that secret cache of books or knew why
he spent so much time in his own. room or exactly what happened to the sleep he
missed.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor pulled at
the loose skin under his chin. &quot;What was your idea in doing that,
son?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I wanted to make
sure I would be interested, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Surely you know
that being interested means nothing. You could be devoured by a subject and if
the physical make-up of your brain makes it more efficient for you to be
something else, something else you will be. You know that, don't you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I've been told
that,&quot; said George cautiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, believe
it. It's true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Antonelli said,
&quot;Or do you believe that studying some subject will bend the brain cells in
that direction, like that other theory that a pregnant woman need only listen
to great music persistently to make a composer of her child. Do you believe that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George flushed. That
had certainly been in his mind. By forcing his intellect constantly in the
desired direction, he had felt sure that he would be getting a head start. Most
of his confidence had rested on exactly that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I never—&quot;
he began, and found no way of finishing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, it isn't
true. Good Lord, youngster, your brain pattern is fixed at birth. It can be
altered by a blow hard enough to damage the cells or by a burst blood vessel or
by a tumor or by a major infection—each time, of course, for the worse. But it
certainly can't be affected by your thinking special thoughts.&quot; He stared
at George thoughtfully, then said, &quot;Who told you to do this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George, now thoroughly
disturbed, swallowed and said, &quot;No one, doctor. My own idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Who knew you were
doing it after you started?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No one. Doctor,
I meant to do no wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Who said
anything about wrong? Useless is what I would say. Why did you keep it to
yourself?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I—I thought
they'd laugh at me.&quot; (He thought abruptly of a recent exchange with Trevelyan.
George had very cautiously broached the thought, as of something merely
circulating distantly in the very outermost reaches of his mind, concerning the
possibility of learning something by ladling it into the mind by hand, so to
speak, in bits and pieces. Trevelyan had hooted, &quot;George, you'll be
tanning your own shoes next and weaving your own shirts.&quot; He had been
thankful then for his policy of secrecy.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Antonelli shoved
the bits of film he had first looked at from position to position in morose thought.
Then he said, &quot;Let's get you analyzed. This is getting me nowhere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The wires went to
George's temples. There was the buzzing. Again there came a sharp memory of ten
years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George's hands were
clammy; his heart pounded. He should never have told the doctor about his
secret reading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was his damned
vanity, he told himself. He had wanted to show how enterprising he was, how
full of initiative. Instead, he had showed himself superstitious and ignorant
and aroused the hostility of the doctor. (He could tell the doctor hated him
for a wise guy on the make.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And now he had brought
himself to such a state of nervousness, he was sure the analyzer would show
nothing that made sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He wasn't aware of the
moment when the wires were removed from his temples. The sight of the doctor,
staring at him thoughtfully, blinked into his consciousness and that was that;
the wires were gone. George dragged himself together with a tearing effort. He
had quite given up his ambition to be a Programmer. In the space of ten
minutes, it had all gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said dismally,
&quot;I suppose no?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No
Programmer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The doctor rubbed his
nose and said, &quot;You get your clothes and whatever belongs to you and go to
room 15-C. Your files will be waiting for you there. So will my report.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said in
complete surprise, &quot;Have I been Educated already? I thought this was just
to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Antonelli stared
down at his desk. &quot;It will all be explained to you. You do as I say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George felt something
like panic. What was it they couldn't tell him? He wasn't fit for anything but
Registered Laborer. They were going to prepare him for that; adjust him to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was suddenly
certain of it and he had to keep from screaming by main force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stumbled back to
his place of waiting. Trevelyan was not there, a fact for which he would have
been thankful if he had had enough self-possession to be meaningfully aware of
his surroundings. Hardly anyone was left, in fact, and the few who were looked
as though they might ask him questions were it not that they were too worn out
by their tail-of-the-alphabet waiting to buck the fierce, hot look of anger and
hate he cast at them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>What right had <i>they
</i>to be technicians and he, himself, a Laborer? Laborer! He was <i>certain!</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was led by a
red-uniformed guide along the busy corridors lined with separate rooms each
containing its groups, here two, there five: the Motor Mechanics, the Construction
Engineers, the Agronomists—There were hundreds of specialized Professions and
most of them would be represented in this small town by one or two anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He hated them all just
then: the Statisticians, the Accountants, the lesser breeds and the higher. He
hated them because they owned their smug knowledge now, knew their fate, while
he himself, empty still, had to face some kind of further red tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He reached 15-C, was
ushered in and left in an empty room. For one moment, his spirits bounded.
Surely, if this were the Labor classification room, there would be dozens of
youngsters present.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A door sucked into its
recess on the other side of a waist-high partition and an elderly, white-haired
man stepped out. He smiled and showed even teeth that were obviously false, but
his face was still ruddy and unlined and his voice had vigor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Good
evening, George. Our own sector has only one of you this time, I see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Only one?&quot;
said George blankly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Thousands over
the Earth, of course. Thousands. You're not alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George felt
exasperated. He said, &quot;I don't understand, sir. What's my classification?
What's happening?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Easy, son.
You're all right. It could happen to anyone.&quot; He held out his hand and
George took it mechanically. It was warm and it pressed George's hand firmly.
&quot;Sit down, son. I'm Sam Ellenford.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George nodded
impatiently. &quot;I want to know what's going on, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course. To
begin with, you can't be a Computer Programmer, George. You've guessed that, I
think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, I
have,&quot; said George bitterly. &quot;What will I be, then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's the hard
part to explain, George.&quot; He paused, then said with careful distinctness,
&quot;Nothing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What!&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Nothing!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But what does
that mean? Why can't you assign me a profession?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We have no
choice in the matter, George. It's the structure of your mind that decides
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George went a sallow
yellow. His eyes bulged. &quot;There's something wrong with my mind?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;There's <i>something
</i>about it. As far as professional classification is concerned, I suppose you
can call it wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ellenford shrugged.
&quot;I'm sure you know how Earth runs its Educational program, George.
Practically any human being can absorb practically any body of knowledge, but
each individual brain pattern is better suited to receiving some types of
knowledge than others. We try to match mind to knowledge as well as we can
within the limits of the quota requirements for each profession.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George nodded.
&quot;Yes, I know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Every once in a
while, George, we come up against a young man whose mind is not suited to
receiving a superimposed knowledge of any sort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean I can't
be Educated?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That is what I
mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But that's
crazy. I'm intelligent. I can understand—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He looked helplessly
about as though trying to find some way of proving that he had a functioning
brain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't
misunderstand me, please,&quot; said Ellenford gravely. &quot;You're
intelligent. There's no question about that. You're even above average in
intelligence. Unfortunately that has nothing to do with whether the mind ought
to be allowed to accept superimposed knowledge or not. In fact, it is almost
always the intelligent person who comes here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean I can't
even be a Registered Laborer?&quot; babbled George. Suddenly even that was
better than the blank that faced him. &quot;What's there to know to be a
Laborer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't
underestimate the Laborer, young man. There are dozens of subclassifications
and each variety has its own corpus of fairly detailed knowledge. Do you think
there's no skill in knowing the proper manner of lifting a weight? Besides, for
the Laborer, we must select not only  minds suited to it, but bodies as well.
You're not the type, George, to last long as a Laborer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George was conscious
of his slight build. He said, &quot;But I've never heard of anyone without a
profession.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;There aren't
many,&quot; conceded Ellenford. &quot;And we protect them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Protect them?&quot;
George felt confusion and fright grow higher inside him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You're a ward of
the planet, George. From the time you walked through that door, we've been in
charge of you.&quot; And he smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was a fond smile.
To George it seemed the smile of ownership; the smile of a grown man for a
helpless child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;You
mean, I'm going to be in prison?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course not.
You will simply be with others of your kind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Your kind. </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The words made a kind
of thunder in George's ear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ellenford said,
&quot;You need special treatment. We'll take care of you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>To George's own
horror, he burst into tears. Ellenford walked to the other end of the room and
faced away as though in thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George fought to
reduce the agonized weeping to sobs and then to strangle those. He thought of
his father and mother, of his friends, of Trevelyan, of his own shame—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said rebelliously,
&quot;I learned to read.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Everyone with a
whole mind can do that. We've never found exceptions. It is at this stage that
we discover— exceptions. And when you learned to read, George, we were
concerned about your mind pattern. Certain peculiarities were reported even
then by the doctor in charge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Can't you try
Educating me? You haven't even tried. I'm willing to take the risk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The law forbids
us to do that, George. But look, it will not be bad. We will explain matters to
your family so they will not be hurt. At the place to which you'll be taken,
you'll be allowed privileges. We'll get you books and you can learn what you
will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Dab knowledge in
by hand,&quot; said George bitterly. &quot;Shred by shred. Then, when I die
I'll know enough to be a Registered Junior Office Boy, Paper-Clip
Division.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yet I understand
you've already been studying books.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George froze. He was
struck devastatingly by sudden understanding. &quot;That's it...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That fellow
Antonelli. He's knifing me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, George.
You're quite wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't tell me
that.&quot; George was in an ecstasy of fury. &quot;That lousy bastard is
selling me out because he thought I was a little too wise for him. I read books
and tried to get a head start toward programming. Well, what do you want to
square things? Money? You won't get it. I'm getting out of here and when I
finish broadcasting this—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was screaming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ellenford shook his
head and touched a contact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Two men entered on
catfeet and got on either side of George. They pinned his arms to his sides.
One of them used an air-spray hypodermic in the hollow of his right elbow and
the hypnotic entered his vein and had an almost immediate effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>His screams cut off
and his head fell forward. His knees buckled and only the men on either side
kept him erect as he slept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They took care of
George as they said they would; they were good to him and unfailingly kind—about
the way, George thought, he himself would be to a sick kitten he had taken pity
on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They told him that he
should sit up and take some interest in life; and then told him that most
people who came there had the same attitude of despair at the beginning and
that he would snap out of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He didn't even hear
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Ellenford himself
visited him to tell him that his parents had been informed that he was away on
special assignment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George muttered,
&quot;Do they know—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ellenford assured him
at once, &quot;We gave no details.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>At first George had
refused to eat. They fed him intravenously. They hid sharp objects and kept him
under guard. Hali Omani came to be his roommate and his stolidity had a calming
effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>One day, out of sheer
desperate boredom, George asked for a book. Omani, who himself read books
constantly, looked up, smiling broadly. George almost withdrew the request
then, rather than give any of them satisfaction, then thought: What do I care?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He didn't specify the
book and Omani brought one on chemistry. It was in big print, with small words
and many illustrations. It was for teen-agers. He threw the book violently
against the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That's what he would
be always. A teen-ager all his life. A pre-Educate forever and special books
would have to be written for him. He lay smoldering in bed, staring at the
ceiling, and after an hour had passed, he got up sulkily, picked up the book,
and began reading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It took him a week to
finish it and then he asked for another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you want me
to take the first one back?&quot; asked Omani.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George frowned. There
were things in the book he had not understood, yet he was not so lost to shame
as to say so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Omani said,
&quot;Come to think of it, you'd better keep it. Books are meant to be read and
reread.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was that same day
that he finally yielded to Omani's invitation that he tour the place. He dogged
at the Nigerian's feet and took in his surroundings with quick hostile glances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The place was no
prison certainly. There were no walls, no locked doors, no guards. But it was a
prison in that the inmates had no place to go outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was somehow good to
see others like himself by the dozen. It was so easy to believe himself to be
the only one in the world so—maimed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He mumbled, &quot;How
many people here anyway?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Two hundred and
five, George, and this isn't the only place of the sort in the world. There are
thousands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Men looked up as he
passed, wherever he went; in the gymnasium, along the tennis courts; through
the library (he had never in his life imagined books could exist in such numbers;
they were stacked, actually stacked, along long shelves). They stared at him
curiously and he returned the looks savagely. At least <i>they </i>were no
better than he; no call for <i>them </i>to look at him as though he were some
sort of curiosity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Most of them were in
their twenties. George said suddenly, &quot;What happens to the older
ones?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani said, &quot;This
place specializes in the younger ones.&quot; Then, as though he suddenly
recognized an implication in George's question that he had missed earlier, he
shook his head gravely and said, &quot;They're not put out of the way, if
that's what you mean. There are other Houses for older ones.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Who cares?&quot;
mumbled George, who felt he was sounding too interested and in danger of
slipping into surrender.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You might. As
you grow older, you will find yourself in a House with occupants of both
sexes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That surprised George
somehow. &quot;Women, too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course. Do
you suppose women are immune to this sort of thing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George thought of that
with more interest and excitement than he had felt for anything since before
that day when—He forced his thought away from that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani stopped at the
doorway of a room that contained a small closed-circuit television set and a
desk computer. Five or six men sat about the television. Omani said, &quot;This
is a classroom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said,
&quot;What's that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The young men in
there are being educated. Not,&quot; he added, quickly, &quot;in the usual
way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean they're
cramming it in bit by bit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's right.
This is the way everyone did it in ancient times.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>This was what they
kept telling him since he had come to the House but what of it? Suppose there
had been a day when mankind had not known the diatherm-oven. Did that mean he
should be satisfied to eat meat raw in a world where others ate it cooked?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Why do
they want to go through that bit-by-bit stuff?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;To pass the
time, George, and because they're curious.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What good does
it do them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It makes them
happier.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George carried that
thought to bed with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The next day he said
to Omani ungraciously, &quot;Can you get me into a classroom where I can find
out something about programming?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani replied
heartily, &quot;Sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was slow and he
resented it. Why should someone have to explain something and explain it again?
Why should he have to read and reread a passage, then stare at a mathematical
relationship and not understand it at once? That wasn't how other people had to
be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Over and over again,
he gave up. Once he refused to attend classes for a week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But always he
returned. The official in charge, who assigned reading, conducted the
television demonstrations, and even explained difficult passages and concepts,
never commented on the matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George was finally
given a regular task in the gardens and took his turn in the various kitchen
and cleaning details. This was represented to him as being an advance, but he
wasn't fooled. The place might have been far more mechanized than it was, but
they deliberately made work for the young men in order to give them the
illusion of worth-while occupation, of usefulness. George wasn't fooled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were even paid
small sums of money out of which they could buy certain specified luxuries or
which they could put aside for a problematical use in a problemical old age.
George kept his money in an open jar, which he kept on a closet shelf. He had
no idea how much he had accumulated. Nor did he care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He made no real
friends though he reached the stage where a civil good day was in order. He
even stopped brooding (or almost stopped) on the miscarriage of justice that
had placed him there. He would go weeks without dreaming of Antonelli, of his
gross nose and wattled neck, of the leer with which he would push George into a
boiling quicksand and hold him under, till he woke screaming with Omani bending
over him in concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani said to him on a
snowy day in February, &quot;It's amazing how you're adjusting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But that was February,
the thirteenth to be exact, his nineteenth birthday. March came, then April,
and with the approach of May he realized he hadn't adjusted at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The previous May had
passed unregarded while George was still in his bed, drooping and ambitionless.
This May was different.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>All over Earth, George
knew, Olympics would be taking place and young men would be competing, matching
their skills against one another in the fight for a place on a new world. There
would be the holiday atmosphere, the excitement, the news reports, the
self-contained recruiting agents from the worlds beyond space, the glory of
victory or the consolations of defeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>How much of fiction
dealt with these motifs; how much of his own boyhood excitement lay in
following the events of Olympics from year to year; how many of his own plans—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George Platen could
not conceal the longing in his voice. It was too much to suppress. He said,
&quot;Tomorrow's the first of May. Olympics!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And that led to his
first quarrel with Omani and to Omani's bitter enunciation of the exact name of
the institution in which George found himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani gazed fixedly at
George and said distinctly, &quot;A House for the Feeble-minded.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George Platen flushed.
Feeble-minded!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He rejected it
desperately. He said in a monotone, &quot;I'm leaving.&quot; He said it on
impulse. His conscious mind learned it first from the statement as he uttered
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani, who had
returned to his book, looked up. &quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George knew what he
was saying now. He said it fiercely, &quot;I'm leaving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's
ridiculous. Sit down, George, calm yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, no. I'm here
on a frame-up, I tell you. This doctor, Antonelli, took a dislike to me. It's
the sense of power these petty bureaucrats have. Cross them and they wipe out
your life with a stylus mark on some card file.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you back to
that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And staying
there till it's  all straightened out. I'm going to get to Antonelli somehow,
break him, force the truth out of him.&quot; George was breathing heavily and
he felt feverish. Olympics month was here and he couldn't let it pass. If he
did, it would be the final surrender and he would be lost for all time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani threw his legs
over the side of his bed and stood up. He was nearly six feet tall and the
expression on his face gave him the look of a concerned Saint Bernard. He put
his arm about George's shoulder, &quot;If I hurt your feelings—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George shrugged him
off. &quot;You just said what you thought was the truth, and I'm going to prove
it isn't the truth, that's all. Why not? The door's open. There aren't any
locks. No one ever said I couldn't leave. I'll just walk out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right, but
where will you go?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;To the nearest
air terminal, then to the nearest Olympics center. I've got money.&quot; He seized
the open jar that held the wages he had put away. Some of the coins jangled to
the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That will last
you a week maybe. Then what?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;By then I'll
have things settled.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;By then you'll
come crawling back here,&quot; said Omani earnestly, &quot;with all the progress
you've made to do over again. You're mad, George.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Feeble-minded is
the word you used before.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, I'm sorry
I did. Stay here, will you?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you going to
try to stop me?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani compressed his
full lips. &quot;No, I guess I won't. This is your business. If the only way
you can learn is to buck the world and come back with blood on your face, go
ahead. —Well, go ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George was in the
doorway now, looking back over his shoulder. &quot;I'm going&quot;—he came back
to pick up his pocket grooming set slowly—&quot;I hope you don't object to my
taking a few personal belongings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani shrugged. He was
in bed again reading, indifferent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George lingered at the
door again, but Omani didn't look up. George gritted his teeth, turned and
walked rapidly down the empty corridor and out into the night-shrouded grounds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He had expected to be
stopped before leaving the grounds. He wasn't. He had stopped at an all-night
diner to ask directions to an air terminal and expected the proprietor to call
the police. That didn't happen. He summoned a skimmer to take him to the
airport and the driver asked no questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Yet he felt no lift at
that. He arrived at the airport sick at heart. He had not realized how the
outer world would be. He was surrounded by professionals. The diner's proprietor
had had his name inscribed on the plastic shell over the cash register. So and
so, Registered Cook. The man in the skimmer had his license up, Registered
Chauffeur. George felt the bareness of his name and experienced a kind of
nakedness because of it; worse, he felt skinned. But no one challenged him. No
one studied him suspiciously and demanded proof of professional rating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George thought
bitterly: Who would imagine any human being without one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He bought a ticket to
San Francisco on the 3 A.M. plane. No other plane for a sizable Olympics center
was leaving before morning and he wanted to wait as little as possible. As it
was, he sat huddled in the waiting room, watching for the police. They did not
come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was in San
Francisco before noon and the noise of the city struck him like a blow. This
was the largest city he had ever seen and he had been used to silence and calm
for a year and a half now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Worse, it was Olympics
month. He almost forgot his own predicament in his sudden awareness that some of
the noise, excitement, confusion was due to that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Olympics boards
were up at the airport for the benefit of the incoming travelers, and crowds
jostled around each one. Each major profession had its own board. Each listed
directions to the Olympics Hall where the contest for that day for that
profession would be given; the individuals competing and their city of birth;
the Outworld (if any) sponsoring it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was a completely
stylized thing. George had read descriptions often enough in the newsprints and
films, watched matches on television, and even witnessed a small Olympics in
the Registered Butcher classification at the county seat. Even that, which had
no conceivable Galactic implication (there was no Outworlder in attendance, of
course) aroused excitement enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Partly, the excitement
was caused simply by the fact of competition, partly by the spur of local pride
(oh, when there was a hometown boy to cheer for, though he might be a complete
stranger), and, of course, partly by betting. There was no way of stopping the
last.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George found it
difficult to approach the board. He found himself looking at the scurrying,
avid onlookers in a new way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There must have been a
time when they themselves were Olympic material. What had <i>they </i>done?
Nothing!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>If they had been
winners, they would be far out in the Galaxy somewhere, not stuck here on
Earth. Whatever they were, their professions must have made them Earth-bait
from the beginning; or else they had made themselves Earth-bait by inefficiency
at whatever high-specialized professions they had had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Now these failures
stood about and speculated on the chances of newer and younger men. Vultures!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>How he wished they
were speculating on him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He moved down the line
of boards blankly, clinging to the outskirts of the groups about them. He had
eaten breakfast on the strato and he wasn't hungry. He was afraid, though. He
was in a big city during the confusion of the beginning of Olympics
competition. That was protection, sure. The city was full of strangers. No one
would question George. No one would care about George.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>No one would care. Not
even the House, thought George bitterly. They cared for him like a sick kitten,
but if a sick kitten up and wanders off, well, too bad, what can you do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And now that he was in
San Francisco, what did he do? His thoughts struck blankly against a wall. See
someone? Whom? How? Where would he even stay? The money he had left seemed
pitiful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The first shamefaced
thought of going back came to him<u>.</u> He could go to the police— He shook
his head violently as though arguing with a material adversary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A word caught his eye
on one of the boards, gleaming there: <i>Metallurgist. </i>In smaller letters, <i>nonferrous.
</i>At the bottom of a long list of names, in flowing script, <i>sponsored by
Novia.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It induced painful memories:
himself arguing with Trevelyan, so certain that he himself would be a
Programmer, so certain that a Programmer was superior to a Metallurgist, so
certain that he was following the right course, so certain that he was clever—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So clever that he had
to boast to that small-minded, vindictive Antonelli. He had been so sure of
himself that moment when he had been called and had left the nervous Trevelyan
standing there, so cocksure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George cried out in a
short, incoherent high-pitched gasp. Someone turned to look at him, then
hurried on. People brushed past impatiently pushing him this way and that. He
remained staring at the board, openmouthed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was as though the
board had answered his thought. He was thinking &quot;Trevelyan&quot; so hard
that it had seemed for a moment that of course the board would say
&quot;Trevelyan&quot; back at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But that <i>was </i>Trevelyan,
up there. And <i>Armand </i>Trevelyan (Stubby's hated first name; up in lights
for everyone to see) and the right hometown. What's more, Trev had wanted
Novia, aimed for Novia, insisted on Novia; and this competition was sponsored
by Novia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>This had to be Trev;
good old Trev. Almost without thinking, he noted the directions for getting to
the place of competition and took his place in line for a skimmer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then he thought
somberly: Trev made it! He wanted to be a Metallurgist, and he made it!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George felt colder,
more alone than ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a line
waiting to enter the hall. Apparently, Metallurgy Olympics was to be an
exciting and closely fought one. At least, the illuminated sky sign above the
hall said so, and the jostling crowd seemed to think so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It would have been a
rainy day, George thought, from the color of the sky, but San Francisco had
drawn the shield across its breadth from bay to ocean. It was an expense to do
so, of course, but all expenses were warranted where the comfort of Outworlders
was concerned. They would be in town for the Olympics. They were heavy
spenders. And for each recruit taken, there would be a fee both to Earth, and
to the local government from the planet sponsoring the Olympics. It paid to
keep Outworlders in mind of a particular city as a pleasant place in which to
spend Olympics time. San Francisco knew what it was doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George, lost in
thought, was suddenly aware of a gentle pressure on his shoulder blade and a
voice saying, &quot;Are you in line here, young man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The line had moved up
without George's having noticed the widening gap. He stepped forward hastily
and muttered, &quot;Sorry, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was the touch of
two fingers on the elbow of his jacket and he looked about furtively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The man behind him
nodded cheerfully. He had iron-gray hair, and under his jacket he wore an
old-fashioned sweater that buttoned down the front. He said, &quot;I didn't
mean to sound sarcastic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No
offense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right,
then.&quot; He sounded cozily talkative. &quot;I wasn't sure you might not
simply be standing there, entangled with the line, so to speak, only by
accident. I thought you might be a—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A what?&quot;
said George sharply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why, a
contestant, of course. You look young.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George turned away. He
felt neither cozy nor talkative, and bitterly impatient with busybodies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A thought struck him.
Had an alarm been sent out for him? Was his description known, or his picture?
Was Gray-hair behind him trying to get a good look at his face?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He hadn't seen any
news reports. He craned his neck to see the moving strip of news headlines
parading across one section of the city shield, somewhat lackluster against the
gray of the cloudy afternoon sky. It was no use. He gave up at once. The
headlines would never concern themselves with him. This was Olympics time and
the only news worth headlining was the comparative scores of the winners and
the trophies won by continents, nations, and cities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It would go on like
that for weeks, with scores calculated on a per capita basis and every city
finding some way of calculating itself into a position of honor. His own town
had once placed third in an Olympics covering Wiring Technician; third in the
whole state. There was still a plaque saying so in Town Hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George hunched his
head between his shoulders and shoved his hands in his pocket and decided that
made him more noticeable. He relaxed and tried to look unconcerned, and felt no
safer. He was in the lobby now, and no authoritative hand had yet been laid on his
shoulder. He filed into the hall itself and moved as far forward as he could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was with an
unpleasant shock that he noticed Gray-hair next to him. He looked away quickly
and tried reasoning with himself. The man had been right behind him in line
after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Gray-hair, beyond a
brief and tentative smile, paid no attention to him and, besides, the Olympics
was about to start. George rose in his seat to see if he could make out the
position assigned to Trevelyan and at the moment that was all his concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The hall was moderate
in size and shaped in the classical long oval, with the spectators in the two
balconies running completely about the rim and the contestants in the linear
trough down the center. The machines were set up, the progress boards above
each bench were dark, except for the name and contest number of each man. The
contestants themselves were on the scene, reading, talking together; one was
checking his fingernails minutely. (It was, of course, considered bad form for
any contestant to pay any attention to the problem before him until the instant
of the starting signal.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George studied the
program sheet he found in the appropriate slot in the arm of his chair and found
Trevelyan's name. His number was twelve and, to George's chagrin, that was at
the wrong end of the hall. He could make out the figure of Contestant Twelve,
standing with his hands in his pockets, back to his machine, and staring at the
audience as though he were counting the house. George couldn't make out the
face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Still, that was Trev.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George sank back in
his seat. He wondered if Trev would do well. He hoped, as a matter of conscious
duty, that he would, and yet there was something within him that felt
rebelliously resentful. George, professionless, here, watching. Trevelyan,
Registered Metallurgist, Nonferrous, there, competing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George wondered if<i> </i>Trevelyan
had competed in his first year. Sometimes men did, if they felt particularly
confident—or hurried. It involved a certain risk. However efficient the
Educative process, a preliminary year on Earth (&quot;oiling the stiff
knowledge,&quot; as the expression went) insured a higher score.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>If Trevelyan was
repeating, maybe he wasn't doing so well. George felt ashamed that the thought
pleased him just a bit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He looked about. The
stands were almost full. This would be a well-attended Olympics, which meant
greater strain on the contestants—or greater drive, perhaps, depending on the
individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Why Olympics, he
thought suddenly? He had never known. Why was bread called bread?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Once he had asked his
father: &quot;Why do they call it Olympics, Dad?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And his father had
said: &quot;Olympics means competition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George had said:
&quot;Is when Stubby and I fight an Olympics, Dad?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Platen, Senior, had
said: &quot;No. Olympics is a special kind of competition and don't ask silly
questions, You'll know all you have to know when you get Educated.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George, back in the
present, sighed and crowded down into his seat</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>All you have to know!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Funny that the memory
should be so clear now. &quot;When you get Educated.&quot; No one ever said,
&quot;<i>If</i> you get Educated.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He always had asked
silly questions, it seemed to him now. It was as though his mind had some
instinctive foreknowledge of its inability to be Educated and had gone about
asking questions in order to pick up scraps here and there as best it could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And at the House they
encouraged him to do so because they agreed with his mind's instinct. It was
the only way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He sat up suddenly.
What the devil was he doing? Falling for that lie? Was it because Trev was
there before him, an Educee, competing in the Olympics that he himself was
surrendering?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He <i>wasn't </i>feeble-minded!
No!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And the shout of
denial in his mind was echoed by the sudden clamor in the audience as everyone
got to his feet. The box seat in the very center of one long side of the oval
was filling with an entourage wearing the colors of Novia, and the word
&quot;Novia&quot; went up above them on the main board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Novia was a Grade A world
with a large population and a thoroughly developed civilization, perhaps the
best in the Galaxy. It was the kind of world that every Earth-man wanted to
live in someday; or, failing that, to see his children live in. (George
remembered Trevelyan's insistence on Novia as a goal—and there he was competing

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The lights went out in
that section of the ceiling above the audience and so did the wall lights. The
central trough, in which the contestants waited, became floodlit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Again George tried to
make out Trevelyan. Too far.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The clear, polished
voice of the announcer sounded. &quot;Distinguished Novian sponsors. Ladies.
Gentlemen. The Olympics competition for Metallurgist, Nonferrous, is about to begin.
The contestants are—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Carefully and
conscientiously, he read off the list in the program. Names. Home towns.
Educative years. Each name received its cheers, the San Franciscans among them
receiving the loudest. When Trevelyan's name was reached, George surprised
himself by shouting and waving madly. The gray-haired man next to him surprised
him even more by cheering likewise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George could not help
but stare in astonishment and his neighbor leaned over to say (speaking loudly
in order to be heard over the hubbub), &quot;No one here from my home town;
I'll root for yours. Someone you know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George shrank back.
&quot;No.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I noticed you
looking in that direction. Would you like to borrow my glasses?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No. Thank
you.&quot; (Why didn't the old fool mind his own business?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The announcer went on
with other formal details concerning the serial number of the competition, the
method of timing and scoring and so on. Finally, he approached the meat of the
matter and the audience grew silent as it listened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Each contestant
will be supplied with a bar of nonferrous alloy of unspecified composition. He
will be required to sample and assay the bar, reporting all results correctly
to four decimals in per cent. All will utilize for this purpose a Beeman
Microspectrograph, Model FX-2, each of which is, at the moment, not in working
order.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was an
appreciative shout from the audience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Each contestant
will be required to analyze the fault of his machine and correct it. Tools and
spare parts are supplied. The spare part necessary may not be present, in which
case it must be asked for, and time of delivery thereof will be deducted from
final time. Are all contestants ready?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The board above
Contestant Five flashed a frantic red signal. Contestant Five ran off the floor
and returned a moment later. The audience laughed good-naturedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are all

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boards remained
blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Any
questions?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Still blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You may
begin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was, of course,
no way anyone in the audience could tell how any contestant was progressing
except for whatever notations went up on the notice board. But then, that
didn't matter. Except for what professional Metallurgists there might be in the
audience, none would understand anything about the contest professionally in
any case. What was important was who won, who was second, who was third. For
those who had bets on the standings (illegal, but unpreventable) that was
all-important. Everything else might go hang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George watched as
eagerly as the rest, glancing from one contestant to the next, observing how
this one had removed the cover from his microspectrograph with deft strokes of
a small instrument; how that one was peering into the face of the thing; how
still a third was setting his alloy bar into its holder; and how a fourth
adjusted a vernier with such small touches that he seemed momentarily frozen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan was as
absorbed as the rest. George had no wav of telling how he was doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The notice board over
Contestant Seventeen flashed: Focus plate out of adjustment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The audience cheered
wildly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Contestant Seventeen
might be right and he might, of course, be wrong. If the latter, he would have
to correct his diagnosis later and lose time. Or he might never correct his
diagnosis and be unable to complete his analysis or, worse still, end with a
completely wrong analysis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Never mind. For the
moment, the audience cheered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Other boards lit up.
George watched for Board Twelve. That came on finally: .&quot;Sample holder
off-center. New clamp depresser needed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>An attendant went
running to him with a new part. If Trevelyan was wrong, it would mean useless
delay. Nor would the time elapsed in waiting for the part be deducted. George
found himself holding his breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Results were beginning
to go up on Board Seventeen, in gleaming letters: aluminum, 41.2649; magnesium,
22.1914; copper, 10.1001.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Here and there, other
boards began sprouting figures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The audience was in
bedlam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George wondered how
the contestants could work in such pandemonium, then wondered if that were not
even a good thing. A first-class technician should work best under pressure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Seventeen rose from
his place as his board went red-rimmed to signify completion. Four was only two
seconds behind him. Another, then another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan was still
working, the minor constituents of his alloy bar still unreported. With nearly
all contestants standing, Trevelyan finally rose, also. Then, tailing off, Five
rose, and received an ironic cheer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It wasn't over.
Official announcements were naturally delayed. Time elapsed was something, but
accuracy was just as important. And not all diagnoses were of equal difficulty.
A dozen factors had to be weighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Finally, the
announcer's voice sounded, &quot;Winner in the time of four minutes and twelve
seconds, diagnosis correct, analysis correct within an average of zero point
seven parts per hundred thousand, Contestant Number— <i>Seventeen, </i>Henry
Anton Schmidt of—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>What followed was
drowned in the screaming. Number Eight was next and then Four, whose good time
was spoiled by a five part in ten thousand error in the niobium figure. Twelve
was never mentioned. He was an also-ran.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George made his way
through the crowd to the Contestant's Door and found a large clot of humanity
ahead of him. There would be weeping relatives (joy or sorrow, depending) to
greet them, newsmen to interview the top-scorers, or the home-town boys,
autograph hounds, publicity seekers and the just plain curious. Girls, too, who
might hope to catch the eye of a top-scorer, almost certainly headed for Novia
(or perhaps a low-scorer who needed consolation and had the cash to afford it).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George hung back. He
saw no one he knew. With San Francisco so far from home, it seemed pretty safe
to assume that there would be no relatives to condole with Trev on the spot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Contestants emerged,
smiling weakly, nodding at shouts of approval. Policemen kept the crowds far
enough away to allow a lane for walking. Each high-scorer drew a portion of the
crowd off with him, like a magnet pushing through a mound of iron filings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>When Trevelyan walked
out, scarcely anyone was left, (George felt somehow that he had delayed coming
out until just that had come to pass.) There was a cigarette in his dour mouth
and he turned, eyes downcast, to walk off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was the first hint
of home George had had in what was almost a year and a half and seemed almost a
decade and a half. He was almost amazed that Trevelyan hadn't aged, that he was
the same Trev he had last seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George sprang forward.
<i>&quot;Trev!&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan spun about,
astonished. He stared at George and then his hand shot out &quot;George Platen,
<i>what </i>the devil—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And almost as soon as
the look of pleasure had crossed his face, it left. His hand dropped before
George had quite the chance of seizing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Were you in
there?&quot; A curt jerk of Trev's head indicated the hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>'To see me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Didn't do so
well, did I?&quot; He dropped his cigarette and stepped on it, staring off to
the street, where the emerging crowd was slowly eddying and finding its way
into skimmers, while new lines were forming for the next scheduled Olympics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan said heavily,
&quot;So what? It's only the second time I missed. Novia can go shove after the
deal I got today. There are planets that would jump at me fast enough— But,
listen, I haven't seen you since Education Day. Where did you go? Your folks
said you were on special assignment but gave no details and you never wrote.
You might have written.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I should
have,&quot; said George uneasily. &quot;Anyway, I came to say I was sorry the
way things went just now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't be,&quot;
said Trevelyan. &quot;I told you. Novia can go shove—At that I should have
known. They've been saying for weeks that the Beeman machine would be used. All
the wise money was on Beeman machines. The damned Education tapes they ran
through me were for Henslers and who uses Henslers? The worlds in the Go-man
Cluster if you want to call them worlds. Wasn't <i>that </i>a nice deal they
gave me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Can't you complain
to—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't be a fool.
They'll tell me my brain was built for Henslers. Go argue. <i>Everything </i>went
wrong. I was the only one who had to send out for a piece of equipment. Notice
that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;They deducted
the time for that, though.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sure, but I lost
time wondering if I could be right in my diagnosis when I noticed there wasn't
any clamp depresser in the parts they had supplied. They don't deduct for that.
If it had been a Hensler, I would have <i>known </i>I was right. How could I
match up then? The top winner was a San Franciscan. So were three of the next
four. And the fifth guy was from Los Angeles. They get big-city Educational
tapes. The best available. Beeman spectrographs and all. How do I compete with
them? I came all the way out here just to get a chance at a Novian-sponsored
Olympics in my classification and I might just as well have stayed home. I knew
it, I tell you, and that settles it. Novia isn't the only chunk of rock in
space. Of all the damned—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He wasn't speaking to
George. He wasn't speaking to anyone. He was just uncorked and frothing. George
realized that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said, &quot;If
you knew in advance that the Beemans were going to be used, couldn't you have
studied up on them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;They weren't in
my tapes, I tell you,&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You could have
read—books.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The last word had
tailed off under Trevelyan's suddenly sharp look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan said,
&quot;Are you trying to make a big laugh out of this? You think this is funny?
How do you expect me to read some book and try to memorize enough to match
someone else who <i>knows.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I thought—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You try it. You
try—&quot; Then, suddenly, &quot;What's your profession, by the way?&quot; He
sounded thoroughly hostile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Come on, now. If
you're going to be a wise guy with me, let's see what you've done. You're still
on Earth, I notice, so you're not a Computer Programmer and your special
assignment can't be much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said,
&quot;Listen, Trev, I'm late for an appointment.&quot; He backed away, trying
to smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, you
don't.&quot; Trevelyan reached out fiercely, catching hold of George's jacket.
&quot;You answer my question. Why are you afraid to tell me? What is it with
you? Don't come here rubbing a bad showing in my face, George, unless you can
take it, too. Do you hear me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was shaking George
in frenzy and they were struggling and swaying across the floor, when the Voice
of Doom struck George's ear in the form of a policeman's outraged call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right now. <i>All
</i>right. Break it up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George's heart turned
to lead and lurched sickeningly. The policeman would be taking names, asking to
see identity cards, and George lacked one. He would be questioned and his lack
of profession would show at once; and before Trevelyan, too, who ached with the
pain of the drubbing he had taken and would spread the news back home as a
salve for his own hurt feelings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George couldn't stand
that. He broke away from Trevelyan and made to run, but the policeman's heavy
hand was on his shoulder. &quot;Hold on, there. Let's see your identity
card.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan was fumbling
for his, saying harshly, &quot;I'm Armand Trevelyan, Metallurgist, Nonferrous.
I was just competing in the Olympics. You better find out about him, though,
officer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George faced the two,
lips dry and throat thickened past speech.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Another voice sounded,
quiet, well-mannered. &quot;Officer. One moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The policeman stepped
back. &quot;Yes, sir?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;This young man
is my guest. What is the trouble?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George looked about in
wild surprise. It was the gray-haired man who had been sitting next to him.
Gray-hair nodded benignly at George.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Guest? Was he mad?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The policeman was
saying, &quot;These two were creating a disturbance, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Any criminal
charges? Any damages?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, then, I'll
be responsible.&quot; He presented a small card to the policeman's view and the
latter stepped back at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Trevelyan began indignantly,
&quot;Hold on, now—&quot; but the policeman turned on him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right, now.
Got any charges?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;On your way. The
rest of you—move on.&quot; A sizable crowd had gathered, which now,
reluctantly, unknotted itself and raveled away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George let himself be
led to a skimmer but balked at entering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Thank
you, but I'm not your guest.&quot; (Could it be a ridiculous case of mistaken
identity?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Gray-hair smiled
and said, &quot;You weren't but you are now. Let me introduce myself, I'm
Ladislas Ingenescu, Registered Historian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Come, you will
come to no harm, I assure you. After all, I only wanted to spare you some
trouble with a policeman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you want a
reason? Well, then, say that we're honorary towns-mates, you and I. We both
shouted for the same man, remember, and we townspeople must stick together,
even if the tie is only honorary. Eh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And George, completely
unsure of this man, Ingenescu, and of himself as well, found himself inside the
skimmer. Before he could make up his mind that he ought to get off again, they
were off the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He thought confusedly:
The man has some status. The policeman deferred to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was almost
forgetting that his real purpose here in San Francisco was not to find
Trevelyan but to find some person with enough influence to force a reappraisal
of his own capacity of Education.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It could be that
Ingenescu was such a man. And right in George's lap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Everything could be
working out fine—fine. Yet it sounded hollow in his thought. He was uneasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>During the short skimmer-hop,
Ingenescu kept up an even flow of small-talk, pointing out the landmarks of the
city, reminiscing about past Olympics he had seen. George, who paid just enough
attention to make vague sounds during the pauses, watched the route of flight
anxiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Would they head for
one of the shield-openings and leave the city altogether?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The skimmer landed at
the roof-entry of a hotel and, as he alighted, Ingenescu said, &quot;I hope
you'll eat dinner with me in my room?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said,
&quot;Yes,&quot; and grinned unaffectedly. He was just beginning to realize the
gap left within him by a missing lunch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu let George
eat in silence. Night closed in and the wall lights went on automatically.
(George thought: I've been on my own almost twenty-four hours.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And then over the
coffee, Ingenescu finally spoke again. He said, &quot;You've been acting as
though you think I intend you harm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George reddened, put
down his cup and tried to deny it, but the older man laughed and shook his
head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's so. I've
been watching you closely since I first saw you and I think I know a great deal
about you now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George half rose in
horror.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;But sit down. I only want to help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George sat down but
his thoughts were in a whirl. If the old man knew who he was, why had he not
left him to the policeman? On the other hand, why should he volunteer help?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;You want to know why I should want to help you? Oh, don't look alarmed. I
can't read minds. It's just that my training enables me to judge the little
reactions that give minds away, you see. Do you understand that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George shook his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;Consider my first sight of you. You were waiting in line to watch an
Olympics, and your micro-reactions didn't match what you were doing. The
expression of your face was wrong, the action of your hands was wrong. It meant
that something, in general, was wrong, and the interesting thing was that,
whatever it was, it was nothing common, nothing obvious. Perhaps, I thought, it
was something of which your own conscious mind was unaware.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I couldn't help
but follow you, sit next to you. I followed you again when you left and
eavesdropped on the conversation between your friend and yourself. After that,
well, you were far too interesting an object of study—I'm sorry if that sounds
cold-blooded—for me to allow you to be taken off by a policeman. —Now tell me,
what is it that troubles you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George was in an agony
of indecision. If this was a trap, why should it be such an indirect,
roundabout one? And he <i>had </i>to turn to someone. He had come to the city
to find help and here was help being offered. Perhaps what was wrong was that
it was being offered. It came too easy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;Of course, what you tell me as a Social Scientist is a privileged
communication. Do you know what that means?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It means, it
would be dishonorable for me to repeat what you say to anyone for any purpose.
Moreover no one has the legal right to compel me to repeat it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said, with
sudden suspicion, &quot;I thought you were a Historian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So I am.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Just now you
said you were a Social Scientist.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu broke into
loud laughter and apologized for <i>it </i>when he could talk. &quot;I'm sorry,
young man, I shouldn't laugh, and I wasn't really laughing at you. I was
laughing at Earth and its emphasis on physical science, and the practical
segments of it at that. I'll bet you can rattle off every subdivision of
construction technology or mechanical engineering and yet you're a blank on
social science.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, then what <i>is
</i>social science?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Social science
studies groups of human beings and there are many high-specialized branches to
it, just as there are to zoology, for instance. For instance, there are
Culturists, who study the mechanics of cultures, their growth, development, and
decay. Cultures,&quot; he added, forestalling a question, &quot;are all the
aspects of a way of life. For instance it includes the way we make our living,
the things we enjoy and believe, what we consider good and bad and so on. Do
you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I think I
do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;An Economist—not
an Economic Statistician, now, but an Economist—specializes in the study of the
way a culture supplies the bodily needs of its individual members. A
psychologist specializes in the individual member of a society and how he is
affected by the society. A Futurist specializes in planning the future course
of a society, and a Historian— That's where I come in, now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A Historian
specializes in the past development of our own society and of societies with
other cultures.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George found himself
interested. &quot;Was it different in the past?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I should say it
was. Until a thousand years ago, there was no Education; not what we call
Education, at least.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said, &quot;I
know. People learned in bits and pieces out of books.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why, how do you
know this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I've heard it
said,&quot; said George cautiously. Then, &quot;Is there any use in worrying
about what's happened long ago? I mean, it's all done with, isn't it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's never done
with, my boy. The past explains the present. For instance, why is our
Educational system what it is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George stirred
restlessly. The man kept bringing the subject back to that. He said snappishly,
&quot;Because it's best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ah, but why is
it best? Now you listen to me for one moment and I'll explain. Then you can
tell me if there is any use in history. Even before interstellar travel was developed—&quot;
He broke off at the look of complete astonishment on George's face. &quot;Well,
did you think we always had it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I never gave it
any thought, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm sure you
didn't. But there was a time, four or five thousand years ago when mankind was
confined to the surface of Earth. Even then, his culture had grown quite
technological and his numbers had increased to the point where any failure in
technology would have meant mass starvation and disease. To maintain the
technological level and advance it in the face of an increasing population,
more and more technicians and scientists had to be trained, and yet, as science
advanced, it took longer and longer to train them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;As first
interplanetary and then interstellar travel was developed, the problem grew
more acute. In fact, actual colonization of extra-Solar planets was impossible
for about fifteen hundred years because of lack of properly trained men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The turning
point came when the mechanics of the storage of knowledge within the brain was
worked out. Once that had been done, it became possible to devise Educational
tapes that would modify the mechanics in such a way as to place within the mind
a body of knowledge ready-made so to speak. But you know about <i>that.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Once that was
done, trained men could be turned out by the thousands and millions, and we
could begin what someone has since called the ‘Filling of the Universe.' There
are now fifteen hundred inhabited planets in the Galaxy and there is no end in
sight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you see all
that is involved? Earth exports Education tapes for low-specialized professions
and that keeps the Galactic culture unified. For instance, the Reading tapes
insure a single language for all of us. —Don't look so surprised, other
languages are possible, and in the past were used. Hundreds of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Earth also
exports high-specialized professionals and keeps its own population at an
endurable level. Since they are shipped out in a balanced sex ratio, they act
as self-reproductive units and help increase the populations on the Outworlds
where an increase is needed. Furthermore, tapes and men are paid for in
material which we much need and on which our economy depends. <i>Now </i>do you
understand why our Education is the best way?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Does it help you
to understand, knowing that without it, interstellar colonization was
impossible for fifteen hundred years?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then you see the
uses of history.&quot; The Historian smiled. &quot;And now I wonder if you see
why I'm interested in you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George snapped out of
time and space back to reality. Ingenescu, apparently, didn't talk aimlessly.
All this lecture had been a device to attack him from a new angle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, once again
withdrawn, hesitating, &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Social
Scientists work with societies and societies are made up of people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But people
aren't machines. The professionals in physical science work with machines.
There is only a limited amount to know about a machine and the professionals
know it all. Furthermore, all machines of a given sort are just about alike so
that there is nothing to interest them in any given individual machine. But
people, ah— They are so complex and so different one from another that a Social
Scientist never knows all there is to know or even a good part of what there is
to know. To understand his own specialty, he must always be ready to study
people; particularly unusual specimens.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Like me,&quot;
said George tonelessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I shouldn't call
you a specimen, I suppose, but you are unusual. You're worth studying, and if
you will allow me that privilege then, in return, I will help you if you are in<i>
</i>trouble and if I can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There were pin wheels
whirring in George's mind.—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>All this talk about
people and colonization made possible by Education. It was as though caked
thought within him were being broken up and strewn about mercilessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Let me
think,&quot; and clamped his hands over his ears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He took them away and
said to the Historian, &quot;Will you do something for me, sir?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If I can,&quot;
said the Historian amiably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And everything I
say in this room is a privileged communication. You said so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And I meant
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then get me an
interview with an Outworld official, with—with a Novian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu looked
startled. &quot;Well, now—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You can do
it,&quot; said George earnestly. &quot;You're an important official. I saw the
policeman's look when you put that card in front of his eyes. If you refuse,
I—I won't let you study me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It sounded a silly
threat in George's own ears, one without force. On Ingenescu, however, it
seemed to have a strong effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;That's
an impossible condition. A Novian in Olympics month—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right, then,
get me a Novian on the phone and I’ll make my own arrangements for an
interview.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you think you
can?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know I can.
Wait and see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu stared at
George thoughtfully and then reached for the visiphone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George waited, half
drunk with this new outlook on the whole problem and the sense of power it
brought. It couldn't miss. It <i>couldn't </i>miss. He would be a Novian yet.
He would leave Earth in triumph despite Antonelli and the whole crew of fools
at the House for the (he almost laughed aloud) Feeble-minded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George watched eagerly
as the visiplate lit up. It would open up a window into a room of Novians, a window
into a small patch of Novia transplanted to Earth. In twenty-four hours, he had
accomplished that much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a burst of
laughter as the plate unmisted and sharpened, but for the moment no single head
could be seen but rather the fast passing of the shadows of men and women, this
way and that. A voice was heard, clear-worded over a background of babble.
&quot;Ingenescu? He wants me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then there he was,
staring out of the plate. A Novian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A   genuine Novian
(George had not an atom of doubt.  There was something completely Outworldly
about him. Nothing that could be completely defined, or even momentarily
mistaken.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was swarthy in
complexion with a dark wave of hair combed rigidly back from his forehead. He
wore a thin black mustache and a pointed beard, just as dark, that scarcely
reached below the lower limit of his narrow chin, but the rest of his face was
so smooth that it looked as though it had been depilated permanently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was smiling.
&quot;Ladislas, this goes too far. We fully expect to be spied on, within
reason, during our stay on Earth, but mind reading is out of bounds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Mind reading,
Honorable?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Confess! You
knew I was going to call you this evening. You knew I was only waiting to
finish this drink.&quot; His hand moved up into view and his eye peered through
a small glass of a<i> </i>faintly violet liqueur. &quot;I can't offer you one,
I'm afraid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George, out of range
of Ingenescu's transmitter could not be seen by the Novian. He was relieved at
that. He wanted time to compose himself and he needed it badly. It was as
though he were made up exclusively of restless fingers, drumming, drumming—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But he was right. He
hadn't miscalculated. Ingenescu <i>was </i>important. The Novian called him by
his first name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Good! Things worked
well. What George had lost on Antonelli, he would make up, with advantage, on
Ingenescu. And someday, when he was on his own at last, and could come back to
Earth as powerful a Novian as this one who could negligently joke with
Ingenescu's first name and be addressed as &quot;Honorable&quot; in turn—when
he came back, he would settle with Antonelli. He had a year and a half to pay
back and he—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He all but lost his
balance on the brink of the enticing daydream and snapped back in sudden
anxious realization that he was losing the thread of what was going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian was saying,
&quot;—doesn't hold water. Novia has a civilization as complicated and advanced
as Earth's. We're not Zeston, after all. It's ridiculous that we have to come
here for individual technicians.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said
soothingly, &quot;Only for new models. There is never any certainty that new
models will be needed. To buy the Educational tapes would cost you the same
price as a thousand technicians and how do you know you would need that
many?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian tossed off
what remained of his drink and laughed. (It displeased George, somehow, that a
Novian should be this frivolous. He wondered uneasily if perhaps the Novian
ought not to have skipped that drink and even the one or two before that.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian said,
&quot;That's typical pious fraud, Ladislas. You know we can make use of all the
late models we can get. I collected five Metallurgists this afternoon—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know,&quot;
said Ingenescu. &quot;I was there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Watching me!
Spying!&quot; cried the Novian. &quot;I'll tell you what it is. The new-model
Metallurgists I got differed from the previous model only in knowing the use of
Beeman Spectrographs. The tapes couldn't be modified that much, not that
much&quot; (he held up two fingers close together) &quot;from last year's
model. You introduce the new models only to <i>make </i>us buy and spend and
come here hat in hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We don't <i>make
</i>you buy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, but you sell
late-model technicians to Landonum and so we have to keep pace. It's a
merry-go-round you have us on, you pious Earthmen, but watch out, there may be
an exit somewhere.&quot; There was a sharp edge to his laugh, and it ended
sooner than it should have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;In all honesty, I hope there is. Meanwhile, as to the purpose of my call—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's right, <i>you
</i>called. Oh, well, I've said my say and I suppose next year there'll be a
new model of Metallurgist anyway for us to spend goods on, probably with a new
gimmick for niobium assays and nothing else altered and the next year—But go
on, what is it you want?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I have a young
man here to whom I wish you to speak.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh?&quot; The
Novian looked not completely pleased with that. &quot;Concerning what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I can't say. He
hasn't told me. For that matter he hasn't even told me his name and
profession.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian frowned.
&quot;Then why take up my time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He seems quite
confident that you will be interested in what he has to say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I dare
say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And,&quot; said
Ingenescu, &quot;as a favor to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The<i> </i>Novian
shrugged. &quot;Put him on and tell him to make it short.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu stepped
aside and whispered to George, &quot;Address him as 'Honorable.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George swallowed with
difficulty. This was it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George felt himself
going moist with perspiration. The thought had come so recently, yet it was in
him now so certainly. The beginnings of it had come when he had spoken to
Trevelyan, then everything had fermented and billowed into shape while
Ingenescu had prattled, and then the Novian's own remarks had seemed to nail it
all into place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said,
&quot;Honorable, I've come to show you the exit from the merry-go-round.&quot;
Deliberately, he adopted the Novian's own metaphor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian stared at
him gravely. &quot;What merry-go-round?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You yourself
mentioned it, Honorable. The merry-go-round that Novia is on when you come to
Earth to—to get technicians.&quot; (He couldn't keep his teeth from chattering;
from excitement, not fear.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian said,
&quot;You're trying to say that you know a way by which we can avoid patronizing
Earth's mental super-market. Is that it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir. You
can control your own Educational system.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Umm. Without
tapes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Y—yes,
Honorable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian, without
taking his eyes from George, called out, &quot;Ingenescu, get into view.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Historian moved to
where he could be seen over George's shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian said,
&quot;What is this? I don't seem to penetrate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I assure you
solemnly,&quot; said Ingenescu, &quot;that whatever this is it is being done on
the young man's own initiative, Honorable. I have not inspired this. I have
nothing to do with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, then, what
is the young man to you? Why do you call me on his behalf?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;He is an object of study, Honorable. He has value to me and I humor
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What kind of
value?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's difficult
to explain; a matter of my profession.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian laughed
shortly. &quot;Well, to each his profession.&quot; He nodded to an invisible
person or persons outside plate range. &quot;There's a young man here, a protégé
of Ingenescu or some such thing, who will explain to us how to Educate without
tapes.&quot; He snapped his fingers, and another glass of pale liqueur appeared
in his hand. &quot;Well, young man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The faces on the plate
were multiple now. Men and women, both, crammed in for a view of George, their
faces molded into various shades of amusement and curiosity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George tried to look
disdainful. They were all, in their own ways, Novians as well as the Earthman,
&quot;studying&quot; him as though he were a bug on a pin. Ingenescu was
sitting in a corner, now, watching him owl-eyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Fools, he thought
tensely, one and all. But they would have to understand. He would <i>make </i>them
understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;I was
at the Metallurgist Olympics this afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You, too?&quot;
said the Novian blandly. &quot;It seems all Earth was there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, Honorable,
but I was. I had a friend who competed and who made out very badly because you
were using the Beeman machines. His education had included only the Henslers,
apparently an older model. You said the modification involved was slight.&quot;
George held up two fingers close together in conscious mimicry of the other's
previous gesture. &quot;And my friend had known some time in advance that
knowledge of the Beeman machines would be required.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And what does
that signify?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It was my
friend's lifelong ambition to qualify for Novia. He already knew the Henslers.
He had to know the Beemans to qualify and he knew that. To learn about the
Beemans would have taken just a few more facts, a bit more data, a small amount
of practice perhaps. With a life's ambition riding the scale, he might have
managed this—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And where would
he have obtained a tape for the additional facts and data? Or has Education
become a private matter for home study here on Earth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was dutiful
laughter from the faces in the background.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said,
&quot;That's why he didn't learn, Honorable. He thought he needed a tape. He
wouldn't even try without one, no matter what the prize. He refused to try
without a tape.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Refused, eh?
Probably the type of fellow who would refuse to fly without a skimmer.&quot;
More laughter and the Novian thawed into a smile and said, &quot;The fellow is
amusing. Go on. I'll give you another few moments.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said tensely,
&quot;Don't think this is a joke. Tapes are actually bad. They teach too much;
they're too painless. A man who learns that way doesn't know how to learn any
other way. He's frozen into whatever position he's been taped. Now if a person <i>weren't
</i>given tapes but were forced to learn by hand, so to speak, from the start;
why, then he'd get the habit of learning, and continue to learn. Isn't that
reasonable? Once he has the habit well developed he can be given just a small
amount of tape-knowledge, perhaps, to fill in gaps or fix details. Then he can
make further progress on his own. You can make Beeman Metallurgists out of your
own Hensler Metallurgists in that way and not have to come to Earth for new
models.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian nodded and
sipped at his drink. &quot;And where does everyone get knowledge without tapes?
From interstellar vacuum?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;From books. By
studying the instruments themselves. By <i>thinking.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Books? How does
one understand books without Education?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Books are in
words. Words can be understood for the most part. Specialized words can be
explained by the technicians you already have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What about
reading? Will you allow reading tapes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Reading tapes
are all right, I suppose, but there's no reason you can't learn to read the old
way, too. At least in part.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian said,
&quot;So that you can develop good habits from the start?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot;
George said gleefully. The man was beginning to understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And what about
mathematics?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's the
easiest of all, sir—Honorable. Mathematics is different from other technical
subjects. It starts with certain simple principles and proceeds by steps. You
can start with nothing and learn. It's practically designed for that Then, once
you know the proper types of mathematics, other technical books become quite
understandable. Especially if you start with easy ones.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are there easy
books?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Definitely. Even
if there weren't, the technicians you now have can try to write easy books.
Some of them might be able to put some of their knowledge into words and
symbols.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Good Lord,&quot;
said the Novian to the men clustered about him. &quot;The young devil has an
answer for everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I have. I
have,&quot; shouted George. &quot;Ask me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Have you tried
learning from books yourself? Or is this just theory with you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George turned to look
quickly at Ingenescu, but the Historian was passive. There was no sign of
anything but gentle interest in his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said, &quot;I
have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And do you find
it works?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes,
Honorable,&quot; said George eagerly. &quot;Take me with you to Novia. I can
set up a program and direct—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Wait, I have a
few more questions. How long would it take, do you suppose, for you to become a
Metallurgist capable of handling a Beeman machine, supposing you started from
nothing and did not use Educational tapes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George hesitated.
&quot;Well—years, perhaps.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Two years? Five?
Ten?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I can't say,
Honorable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, there's a
vital question to which you have no answer, have you? Shall we say five years?
Does that sound reasonable to you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I suppose
so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right. We
have a technician studying metallurgy according to this method of yours for
five years. He's no good to us during that time, you'll admit, but he must be
fed and housed and paid all that time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Let me finish.
Then when he's done and can use the Beeman, five years have passed. Don't you
suppose we'll have modified Beemans then which he <i>won't </i>be able to
use?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But by then hell
be expert on learning. He could learn the new details necessary in a matter of
days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So you say. And
suppose this friend of yours, for instance, had studied up on Beemans on his
own and managed to learn it; would he be as expert in its use as a competitor
who had learned it off the tapes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Maybe not—&quot;
began George.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ah,&quot; said
the Novian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Wait, let <i>me </i>finish.
Even if he doesn't know something as well, it's the ability to learn further
that's important. He may be able to think up things, new things that no
tape-Educated man would. You'll have a reservoir of original thinkers—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In your
studying,&quot; said the Novian, &quot;have you thought up any new
things?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, but I'm just
one man and I haven't studied long— »</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes. —Well,
ladies, gentlemen, have we been sufficiently amused?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Wait,&quot;
cried George, in sudden panic. &quot;I want to arrange a personal interview.
There are things I can't explain over the visiphone. There are details—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Novian looked past
George. &quot;Ingenescu! I think I have done you your favor. Now, really, I
have a heavy schedule tomorrow. Be well!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The screen went blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George's hands shot
out toward the screen, as though in a wild impulse to shake life back into it.
He cried out, &quot;He didn't believe me. He didn't believe me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;No, George. Did you really think he would?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George scarcely heard
him. &quot;But why not? It's all true. It's all so much to his advantage. No
risk. I and a few men to work with— A dozen men training for years would cost
less than one technician. —He was drunk!  Drunk! He didn't understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George looked about
breathlessly. &quot;How do I get to him? I've got to. This was wrong. Shouldn't
have used the visiphone. I need time. Face to face. How do I—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;He won't see you, George. And if he did, he wouldn't believe you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He will, I tell
you. When he isn't drinking. He—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George turned squarely
toward the Historian and his eyes widened. &quot;Why do you call me
George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Isn't that your
name? George Platen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You know
me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All about
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George was motionless
except for the breath pumping his chest wall up and down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ingenescu said,
&quot;I want to help you, George. I told you that. I've been studying you and I
want to help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George screamed,
&quot;I don't need help. I'm not feebleminded. The whole world is, but I'm
not.&quot; He whirled and dashed madly for the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He flung it open and
two policemen roused themselves suddenly from their guard duty and seized him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For all George's
straining, he could feel the hypo-spray at the fleshy point just under the
corner of his jaw, and that was it. The last thing he remembered was the face
of Ingenescu, watching with gentle concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George opened his eyes
to the whiteness of a ceiling. He remembered what had happened. He remembered
it distantly as though it had happened to somebody else. He stared at the
ceiling till the whiteness filled his eyes and washed his brain clean, leaving
room, it seemed, for new thought and new ways of thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He didn't know how
long he lay there so, listening to the drift of his own thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a voice in
his ear. &quot;Are you awake?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And George heard his
own moaning for the first tune. Had he been moaning? He tried to turn his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The voice said,
&quot;Are you in pain, George?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George whispered,
&quot;Funny. I was so anxious to leave Earth. I didn't understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you know
where you are?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Back in the—the
House.&quot; George managed to turn. The voice belonged to Omani.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said,
&quot;It's funny I didn't understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani smiled gently,
&quot;Sleep again—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And woke again. His
mind was clear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani sat at the
bedside reading, but he put down the book as George's eyes opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George struggled to a
sitting position. He said, &quot;Hello.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you
hungry?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You bet.&quot;
He stared at Omani curiously. &quot;I was followed when I left, wasn't I?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani nodded. &quot;You
were under observation at all times. We were going to maneuver you to Antonelli
and let you discharge your aggressions. We felt that to be the only way you
could make progress. Your emotions were clogging your advance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said, with a
trace of embarrassment, &quot;I was all wrong about him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It doesn't
matter now. When you stopped to stare at the Metallurgy notice board at the
airport, one of our agents reported back the list of names. You and I had
talked about your past sufficiently so that I caught the significance of
Trevelyan's name there. You asked for directions to the Olympics; there was the
possibility that this might result in the kind of crisis we were hoping for; we
sent Ladislas Ingenescu to the hall to meet you and take over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He's an important
man in the government, isn't he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, he
is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you had him
take over. It makes me sound important.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You <i>are </i>important,
George.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A thick stew had
arrived, steaming, fragrant. George grinned wolfishly and pushed his sheets
back to free his arms. Omani helped arrange the bed-table. For a while, George
ate silently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then George said,
&quot;I woke up here once before just for a short time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani said, &quot;I
know. I was here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, I remember.
You know, everything was changed. It was as though I was too tired to feel
emotion. I wasn't angry any more. I could just think. It was as though I had
been drugged to wipe out emotion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You
weren't,&quot; said Omani. &quot;Just sedation. You had rested.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, anyway, it
was all clear to me, as though I had known it all the time but wouldn’t listen
to myself.  I thought: What was it I had wanted Novia to let me do? I had
wanted to go to Novia and take a batch of un-Educated youngsters and teach them
out of books. I had wanted to establish a House for the Feeble-minded—like here—and
Earth already has them—many of them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Omani's white teeth
gleamed as he smiled. &quot;The Institute of Higher Studies is the correct name
for places like this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now I see
it,&quot; said George, &quot;so easily I am amazed at my blindness before.
After all, who invents the new instrument models that require new-model
technicians? Who invented the Beeman spectrographs, for instance? A man called
Beeman, I suppose, but he couldn't have been tape-Educated or how could he have
made the advance?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Or who makes
Educational tapes? Special tape-making technicians? Then who makes the tapes to
train <i>them? </i>More advanced technicians? Then who makes the tapes— You see
what I mean. Somewhere there has to be an end. Somewhere there must be men and
women with capacity for original thought.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes,
George.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George leaned back,
stared over Omani's head, and for a moment there was the return of something
like restlessness to his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why wasn't I
told all this at the beginning?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, if we
could,&quot; said Omani, &quot;the trouble it would save us. We can analyze a
mind, George, and say this one will make an adequate architect and that one a
good woodworker. We know of no way of detecting the capacity for original,
creative thought. It is too subtle a thing. We have some rule-of-thumb methods
that mark out individuals who may possibly or potentially have such a talent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;On Reading Day,
such individuals are reported. You were, for instance. Roughly speaking, the
number so reported comes to one in ten thousand. By the time Education Day
arrives, these individuals are checked again, and nine out of ten of them turn
out to have been false alarms. Those who remain are sent to places like
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George said,
&quot;Well, what's wrong with telling people that one out of—of a hundred
thousand will end at places like these? Then it won't be such a shock to those
who do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And those who
don't? The ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine that don't? We
can't have all those people considering themselves failures. They aim at the
professions and one way or another they all make it. Everyone can place after
his or her name: Registered something-or-other. In one fashion or another every
individual has his or her place in society and this is necessary.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But we?&quot;
said George. &quot;The one in ten thousand exception?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You can't be
told. That's exactly it. It's the final test. Even after we've thinned out the
possibilities on Education Day, nine out of ten of those who come here are not
quite the material of creative genius, and there's no way we can distinguish
those nine from the tenth that we want by any form of machinery. The tenth one
must tell us himself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We bring you
here to a House for the Feeble-minded and the man who won't accept that is the
man we want. It's a method that can be cruel, but it works. It won't do to say
to a man, 'You can create. Do so.&quot; It is much safer to wait for a man to
say, 'I can create, and I will do so whether you wish it or not.' There are ten
thousand men like you, George, who support the advancing technology of fifteen
hundred worlds. We can't allow ourselves to miss one recruit to that number or
waste our efforts on one member who doesn't measure up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>George pushed his

font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jehan Shuman was used to dealing with the men
in authority on long-embattled Earth. He was only a civilian but he originated
programming patterns that resulted in self-directing war computers of the

committees, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was one of each
in the special lounge of New Pentagon. General Weider was space-burnt and had a
small mouth puckered almost into a cipher. Congressman Brant was smooth-cheeked
and clear-eyed. He smoked Denebian tobacco with the air of one whose patriotism
was so notorious, he could be allowed such liberties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The little man, in
return, twisted the fingers of his hands anxiously. He had never been near such
great men before. He was only an aging low-grade Technician who had long ago
failed all tests designed to smoke out the gifted ones among mankind and had
settled into the rut of unskilled labor. There was just this hobby of his that
the great Programmer had found out about and was now making such a frightening
fuss over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

firstcomer.—Aub!&quot; There was something imperative about his manner of
biting off that one-syllable name, but then he was a great Programmer speaking
to a mere Technician. &quot;Aub! How much is nine times seven?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Aub hesitated a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The congressman took
out his pocket computer, nudged the milled edges twice, looked at its face as
it lay there in the palm of his hand, and put it back. He said, &quot;Is this
the gift you brought us here to demonstrate. An illusionist?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;More than that,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, sir,&quot;
said Shuman patiently. &quot;Not a paper computer. Simply a sheet of paper.
General, would you be so kind as to suggest a number?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Seventeen,&quot;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Good! Aub,
multiply those numbers and please show the gentlemen your manner of doing
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes,
Programmer,&quot; said Aub, ducking his head. He fished a small pad out of one
shirt pocket and an artist's hairline stylus out of the other. His forehead
corrugated as he made painstaking marks on the paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>General Weider

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Aub passed him the
paper, and Weider said, &quot;Well, it looks like the figure seventeen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Congressman Brant
nodded and said, &quot;So it does, but I suppose anyone can copy figures off a
computer. I think I could make a passable seventeen myself, even without
practice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If you will let
Aub continue, gentlemen,&quot; said Shuman without heat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Aub continued, his
hand trembling a little. Finally he said in a low voice, &quot;The answer is
three hundred and ninety-one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Congressman Brant took
out his computer a second time and nicked it, &quot;By Godfrey, so it is. How
did he guess?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No guess,
Congressman,&quot; said Shuman. &quot;He computed that result. He did it on
this sheet of paper.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Humbug,&quot;
said the general impatiently. &quot;A computer is one thing and marks on paper
are another.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Explain,
Aub,&quot; said Shuman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, Programmer.
—Well, gentlemen, I write down seventeen and just underneath it, I write
twenty-three. Next, I say to myself: seven times three—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The congressman
interrupted smoothly, &quot;Now, Aub, the problem is seventeen times
twenty-three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, I
know,&quot; said the little Technician earnestly, &quot;but I <i>start </i>by
saying seven times three because that's the way it works. Now seven times three
is twenty-one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And how do you
know that?&quot; asked the congressman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I just remember
it. It's always twenty-one on the computer. I've checked it any number of
times.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That doesn't
mean it always will be, though, does it?&quot; said the congressman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Maybe not,&quot;
stammered Aub. &quot;I'm not a mathematician. But I always get the right
answers, you see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Go on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Seven times
three is twenty-one, so I write down twenty-one. Then one times three is three,
so I write down a three under the two of twenty-one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why under the
two?&quot; asked Congressman Brant at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Because—&quot;
Aub looked helplessly at his superior for support. &quot;It's difficult to
explain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Shuman said, &quot;If
you will accept his work for the moment, we can leave the details for the
mathematicians.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brant subsided.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Aub said, &quot;Three
plus two makes five, you see, so the twenty-one become a fifty-one. Now you let
that go for a while and start fresh. You multiply seven and two, that's fourteen,
and one and two, that's two. Put them down like this and it adds up to
thirty-four. Now if you put the thirty-four under the fifty-one this way and
add them, you get three hundred and ninety-one and that's the answer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was an instant's
silence and then General Weider said, &quot;I don't believe it. He goes through
this rigmarole and makes up numbers and multiplies and adds them this way and
that, but I don't believe it. It's too complicated to be anything but
hornswoggling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh no,
sir,&quot; said Aub hi a sweat, &quot;It only <i>seems </i>complicated because
you're not used to it. Actually, the rules are quite simple and will work for
any numbers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Any numbers,
eh?&quot; said the general. &quot;Come then.&quot; He took out his own computer
(a severely styled GI model) and struck it at random. &quot;Make a five seven
three eight on the paper. That's five thousand seven hundred and
thirty-eight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot;
said Aub, taking a new sheet of paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now,&quot; (more
punching of his computer), &quot;seven two three nine. Seven thousand two
hundred and thirty-nine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And now multiply
those two.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It will take
some time,&quot; quavered Aub.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Take the time,&quot;
said the general.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Go ahead,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Aub set to work,
bending low. He took another sheet of paper and another. The general took out
his watch finally and stared at it. &quot;Are you through with your
magic-making, Technician?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm almost done,
sir. —Here it is, sir. Forty-one million, five hundred and thirty-seven

the result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>General Weider smiled
bitterly. He pushed the multiplication contact on his computer and let the
numbers whirl to a halt. And then he stared and said in a surprised squeak,
&quot;Great Galaxy, the fella's right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The President of the
Terrestrial Federation had grown haggard in office and, in private, he allowed
a look of settled melancholy to appear on his sensitive features. The Denebian
war, after its early start of vast movement matter of maneuver and
countermaneuver, with discontent rising steadily on Earth. Possibly, it was
rising on Deneb, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And now Congressman
Brant, head of the important Committee on Military Appropriations was
cheerfully and smoothly spending his half-hour appointment spouting nonsense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Computing

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Computing,&quot;
said the congressman, &quot;is only a system for handling data. A machine might
do it, or the human brain might. Let me give you an example.&quot; And, using
the new skills he had learned, he worked out sums and products until the
president, despite himself, grew interested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,&quot; said
the president, considering, &quot;it's an interesting parlor game, but what is
the use of it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What is the use
of a newborn baby, Mr. President? At the moment there is no use, but don't you
see that this points the way toward liberation from the machine. Consider, Mr.
President,&quot; the congressman rose and his deep voice automatically took on
some of the cadences he used in public debate, &quot;that the Denebian war is a
war of computer against computer. Their computers forge an impenetrable shield
of counter-missiles against our missiles, and ours forge one against theirs. If
we advance the efficiency of our computers, so do they theirs, and for five
years a precarious and profitless balance has existed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now we have in
our hands a method for going beyond the computer, leapfrogging it, passing
through it. We will combine the mechanics of computation with human thought; we
will have the equivalent of intelligent computers; billions of them. I can't predict
what the consequences will be in detail but they will be incalculable. And if
Deneb beats us to the punch, they may be unimaginably catastrophic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The president said,
troubled, &quot;What would you have me do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>“Put the power of the
Administration behind the establishment of a secret project on human
computation.  Call it Project Number, if you like. I can vouch for my
committee, but I will need the administration behind me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But how far can
human computation go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;There is no
limit. According to Programmer Shuman, who first introduced me to this
discovery—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I've heard of
Shuman, of course.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes. Well, Dr.
Shuman tells me that in theory there is nothing the computer can do that the
human mind can not do. The computer merely takes a finite amount of data and performs
a finite number of operations upon them. The human mind can duplicate the
process.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The president
considered that. He said, &quot;If Shuman says this, I am inclined to believe
him—in theory. But, in practice, how can anyone know how a computer
works?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brant laughed
genially. &quot;Well, Mr. President, I asked the same question. It seems that
at one time computers were designed directly by human beings. Those were simple
computers, of course, this being before the time of the rational use of
computers to design more advanced computers had been established.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, yes. Go
on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Technician Aub
apparently had, as his hobby, the reconstruction of some of these ancient
devices and in so doing he studied the details of their workings and found he
could imitate them. The multiplication I just performed for you is an imitation
of the workings of a computer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Amazing!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The congressman
coughed gently, &quot;If I may make another point, Mr. President— The further
we can develop this thing, the more we can divert our Federal effort from
computer production and computer maintenance. As the human brain takes over,
more of our energy can be directed into peacetime pursuits and the impingement
of war on the ordinary man will be less. This will be most advantageous for the
party in power, of course.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ah,&quot; said
the president, &quot;I see your point. Well, sit down, Congressman, sit down. I
want some time to think about this. —But meanwhile, show me that multiplication
trick again. Let's see if I can't catch the point of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Programmer Shuman did
not try to hurry matters. Loesser was conservative, very conservative, and
liked to deal with computers as his father and grandfather had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Still, he controlled
the West European computer combine, and if he could be persuaded to join
Project Number in full enthusiasm, a great deal would be accomplished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Loesser was
holding back. He said, &quot;I'm not sure I like the idea of relaxing our hold
on computers. The human mind is a capricious thing. The computer will give the
same answer to the same problem each time. What guarantee have we that the
human mind will do the same?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The human mind,
Computer Loesser, only manipulates facts. It doesn't matter whether the human
mind or a machine does it. They are just tools.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, yes. I've
gone over your ingenious demonstration that the mind can duplicate the computer
but it seems to me a little in the air. I'll grant the theory but what reason
have we for thinking that theory can be converted to practice?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I think we have
reason, sir. After all, computers have not always existed. The cave men with
their triremes, stone axes, and railroads had no computers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And possibly
they did not compute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You know better
than that. Even the building of a railroad or a ziggurat called for some
computing, and that must have been without computers as we know them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you suggest
they computed in the fashion you demonstrate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Probably not.
After all, this method—we call it 'graphitics,' by the way, from the old
European word 'graph’* meaning 'to write'—is developed from the computers
themselves so it cannot have antedated them. Still, the cave men must have had <i>some
</i>method, eh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Lost arts! If
you're going to talk about lost arts—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, no. I'm not
a lost art enthusiast, though I don't say there may not be some. After all, man
was eating grain before hydroponics, and if the primitives ate grain, they must
have grown it in soil. What else could they have done?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't know,
but I'll believe in soil-growing when I see someone grow grain in soil. And
I'll believe in making fire by rubbing two pieces of flint together when I see
that, too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Shuman grew placative.
&quot;Well, let's stick to graphitics. It's just part of the process of
etherealization. Transportation by means of bulky contrivances is giving way to
direct mass-transference. Communications devices become less massive and more
efficient constantly. For that matter, compare your pocket computer with the
massive jobs of a thousand years ago. Why not, then, the last step of doing
away with computers altogether? Come, sir, Project Number is a going concern;
progress is already headlong. But we want your help. If patriotism doesn't move
you, consider the intellectual adventure involved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Loesser said
skeptically, &quot;What progress? What can you do beyond multiplication? Can
you integrate a transcendental function?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In time, sir. In
time. In the last month I have learned to handle division. I can determine, and
correctly, integral quotients and decimal quotients.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Decimal
quotients? To how many places?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Programmer Shuman
tried to keep his tone casual. &quot;Any number!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Loesser's lower jaw
dropped. &quot;Without a computer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Set me a
problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Divide
twenty-seven by thirteen. Take it to six places.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Five minutes later,
Shuman said, &quot;Two point oh seven six nine two three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Loesser checked it.
&quot;Well, now, that's amazing. Multiplication didn't impress me too much
because it involved integers after all, and I thought trick manipulation might
do it. But decimals—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And that is not
all. There is a new development that is, so far, top secret and which, strictly
speaking, I ought not to mention. Still— We may have made a breakthrough on the
square root front.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Square
roots?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It involves some
tricky points and we haven't licked the bugs yet, but Technician Aub, the man
who invented the science and who has an amazing intuition in connection with
it, maintains he has the problem almost solved. And he is only a Technician. A
man like yourself, a trained and talented mathematician ought to have no
difficulty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Square

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Cube roots, too.
Are you with us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Loesser's hand thrust
out suddenly, &quot;Count me in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>General Weider stumped
his way back and forth at the head of the room and addressed his listeners
after the fashion of a savage teacher facing a group of recalcitrant students.
It made no difference to the general that they were the civilian scientists
heading Project Number. The general was the over-all head, and he so considered
himself at every waking moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Now
square roots are all fine. I can't do them myself and I don't understand the
methods, but they're fine. Still, the Project will not be sidetracked into what
some of you call the fundamentals. You can play with graphitics any way you
want to after the war is over, but right now we have specific and very
practical problems to solve.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In a far corner,
Technician Aub listened with painful attention. He was no longer a Technician,
of course, having been relieved of his duties and assigned to the project, with
a fine-sounding title and good pay. But, of course, the social distinction
remained and the highly placed scientific leaders could never bring themselves
to admit him to their ranks on a footing of equality. Nor, to do Aub justice,
did he, himself, wish it. He was as uncomfortable with them as they with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The general was
saying, &quot;Our goal is a simple one, gentlemen; the replacement of the
computer. A ship that can navigate space without a computer on board can be
constructed in one fifth the time and at one tenth the expense of a
computer-laden ship. We could build fleets five times, ten times, as great as
Deneb could if we could but eliminate the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And I see
something even beyond this. It may be fantastic now; a mere dream; but in the
future I see the manned missile!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was an instant
murmur from the audience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The general drove on.
&quot;At the present time, our chief bottleneck is the fact that missiles are
limited in intelligence. The computer controlling them can only be so large,
and for that reason they can meet the changing nature of anti-missile defenses
in an unsatisfactory way. Few missiles, if any, accomplish their goal and
missile warfare is coming to a dead end; for the enemy, fortunately, as well as
for ourselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;On the other
hand, a missile with a man or two within, controlling flight by graphitics,
would be lighter, more mobile, more intelligent. It would give us a lead that
might well mean the margin of victory. Besides which, gentlemen, the exigencies
of war compel us to remember one thing. A man is much more dispensable than a
computer. Manned missiles could be launched in numbers and under circumstances
that no good general would care to undertake as far as computer-directed missiles
are concerned—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said much more but
Technician Aub did not wait.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Technician Aub, in the
privacy of his quarters, labored long over the note he was leaving behind. It
read finally as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;When I began the
study of what is now called graphitics, it was no more than a hobby. I saw no
more in it than an interesting amusement, an exercise of mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;When Project
Number began, I thought that others were wiser than I; that graphitics might be
put to practical use as a benefit to mankind, to aid in the production of
really practical mass-transference devices perhaps. But now I see it is to be
used only for death and destruction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I cannot face
the responsibility involved in having invented graphitics.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He then deliberately
turned the focus of a protein-depolarizer on himself and fell instantly and
painlessly dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They stood over the
grave of the little Technician while tribute was paid to the greatness of his
discovery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Programmer Shuman
bowed his head along with the rest of them, but remained unmoved. The Technician
had done his share and was no longer needed, after all. He might have started
graphitics, but now that it had started, it would carry on by itself
overwhelmingly, triumphantly, until manned missiles were possible with who knew
what else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Nine times seven,
thought Shuman with deep satisfaction, is sixty-three, and I don't need a
computer to tell me so. The computer is in my own head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

better off than I am, Kaunas. Mercurian gravity is 0.4 normal. On the Moon,
it's only 0.16.&quot; He interrupted Ryger's beginning of a sound by saying,
&quot;And on Ceres they use pseudo-grav fields adjusted to 0.8. You have no
problems at all, Ryger.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Cerian astronomer
looked annoyed, &quot;It's the open air. Going outside without a suit gets
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Right,&quot;
agreed Kaunas, &quot;and letting the sun beat down on you. Just letting it
&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro found
himself insensibly drifting back in time. They had not changed much. Nor, he
thought, had he himself. They were all ten years older, of course. Ryger had
put on some weight and Kaunas's thin face had grown a bit leathery, but he
would have recognized either if he had met him without warning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;I don't
think it's Earth getting us. Let's face it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas looked up
sharply. He was a little fellow with quick, nervous movements of his hands. He
habitually wore clothes that looked a shade too large for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said,
&quot;Villiers! I know. I think about him sometimes.&quot; Then, with an air of
desperation, &quot;I got a letter from him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger sat upright, his
olive complexion darkening further and said with energy, &quot;You did?
When?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A month
ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger turned to
Talliaferro. &quot;How about you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro blinked
placidly and nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger said, &quot;He's
gone crazy. He claims he's discovered a practical method of mass-transference
through space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>—He told you two also?
—That's it, then. He was always a little bent. Now he's broken.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He rubbed his nose
fiercely and Talliaferro thought of the day Villiers had broken it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For ten years,
Villiers had haunted them like the vague shadow of a guilt that wasn't really
theirs. They had gone through their graduate work together, four picked and
dedicated men being trained for a profession that had reached new heights in
this age of interplanetary travel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Observatories were
opening on the other worlds, surrounded by vacuum, unblurred by air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was the Lunar
Observatory, from which Earth and the inner planets could be studied; a silent
world in whose sky the home-planet hung suspended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mercury Observatory,
closest to the sun, perched at Mercury's north pole, where the terminator moved
scarcely at all, and the sun was fixed on the horizon and could be studied in
the minutest detail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ceres Observatory,
newest, most modern, with its range extending from Jupiter to the outermost
galaxies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There were
disadvantages, of course. With interplanetary travel still difficult, leaves
would be few, anything like normal life virtually impossible, but this was a
lucky generation. Coming scientists would find the fields of knowledge
well-reaped and, until the invention of an interstellar drive, no new horizon
as capacious as this one would be opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Each of these lucky
four, Talliaferro, Ryger, Kaunas, and Villiers, was to be in the position of a
Galileo, who by owning the first real telescope, could not point it anywhere in
the sky without making a major discovery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But then Romero
Villiers had fallen sick and it was rheumatic fever. Whose fault was that? His
heart had been left leaking and limping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was the most
brilliant of the four, the most hopeful, the most intense—and he could not even
finish his schooling and get his doctorate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Worse than that, he
could never leave Earth; the acceleration of a spaceship's take-off would kill
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro was marked
for the Moon, Ryger for Ceres, Kaunas for Mercury. Only Villiers stayed behind,
a life-prisoner of Earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They had tried telling
their sympathy and Villiers had rejected it with something approaching hate. He
had railed at them and cursed them. When Ryger lost his temper and lifted his
fist, Villiers had sprung at him, screaming, and had broken Ryger's nose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Obviously Ryger hadn't
forgotten that, as he caressed his nose gingerly with one finger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas's forehead was
an uncertain washboard of wrinkles. &quot;He's at the Convention, you know.
He's got a room in the hotel—405.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;<i>I</i> won't
see him,&quot; said Ryger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He's coming up
here. He said he wanted to see us. I thought—He said nine. He'll be here any
minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In that
case,&quot; said Ryger, &quot;if you don't mind, I'm leaving.&quot; He rose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said,
&quot;Oh, wait a while. What's the harm in seeing him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Because there's
no point. He's mad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Even so. Let's
not be petty about it. Are you afraid of him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Afraid!&quot;
Ryger looked contemptuous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Nervous, then.
What is there to be nervous about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm not
nervous,&quot; said Ryger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sure you are. We
all feel guilty about him, and without real reason. Nothing that happened was
our fault.&quot; But he was speaking defensively and he knew it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And when, at that
point, the door signal sounded, all three jumped and turned to stare uneasily
at the barrier that stood between themselves and Villiers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The door opened and
Romero Villiers walked in. The others rose stiffly to greet him, then remained
standing in embarrassment, without one hand being raised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stared them down
sardonically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He's </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>changed, thought
Talliaferro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He had. He had
shrunken in almost every dimension. A gathering stoop made him seem even
shorter. The skin of his scalp glistened through thinning hair, the skin on the
back of his hands was ridged crookedly with bluish veins. He looked ill. There
seemed nothing to link him to the memory of the past except for his trick of
shading his eyes with one hand when he stared intently and, when he spoke, the
even, controlled baritone of his voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;My
friends! My space-trotting friends! We've lost touch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said,
&quot;Hello, Villiers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Villiers eyed him.
&quot;Are you well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well
enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you
two?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas managed a weak
smile and a murmur. Ryger snapped, &quot;All right, Villiers. What's up?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ryger, the angry
man,&quot; said Villiers. &quot;How's Ceres?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It was doing
well when I left. How's Earth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You can see for
yourself,&quot; but Villiers tightened as he said that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He went on, &quot;I am
hoping that the reason all three of you have come to the Convention is to hear
my paper day after tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Your paper? What
paper?&quot; asked Talliaferro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I wrote you all
about it. My method of mass-transference.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger smiled with one
corner of his mouth. &quot;Yes, you did. You didn't say anything about a paper,
though, and I don't recall that you're listed as one of the speakers. I would
have noticed it if you had been.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You're right.
I'm not listed. Nor have I prepared an abstract for publication.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Villiers had flushed
and Taliaferro said soothingly, &quot;Take it easy, Villiers. You don't look
well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Villiers whirled on
him, lips contorted. &quot;My heart's holding out, thank you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas said,
&quot;Listen, Villiers, if you're not listed or abstracted—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>listen. I've waited
ten years. You have the jobs in space and I have to teach school on Earth, but
I'm a better man than any of you or all of you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Granted—&quot;
began Talliaferro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And I don't want
your condescension either. Mandel witnessed it. I suppose you've heard of
Mandel. Well, he's chairman of the astronautics division at the Convention and
I demonstrated mass-transference for him. It was a crude device and it burnt
out after one use but—Are</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>you listening?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We're
listening,&quot; said Ryger coldly, &quot;for what that counts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He'll let me
talk about it my way. You bet he will. No warning. No advertisement. I'm going
to spring it at them like a bombshell. When I give them the fundamental
relationships involved it will break up the Convention. They'll scatter to
their home labs to check on me and build devices. And they'll find it works. I
made a live mouse disappear at one spot in my lab and appear in another. Mandel
witnessed it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stared at them,
glaring first at one face, then at another. He said, &quot;You don't believe
me, do you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger said, &quot;If
you don't want advertisement, why do you tell us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You're
different. You're my friends, my classmates. You went out into space and left
me behind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That wasn't a
matter of choice,&quot; objected Kaunas in a thin, high voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Villiers ignored that.
He said, &quot;So I want you to know <i>now. </i>What will work for a mouse
will work for a human. What will move something ten feet across a lab will move
it a million miles across space. I'll be on the Moon, <i>and </i>on Mercury, <i>and
</i>on Ceres and anywhere I want to go. I'll match every one of you and more.
And I'll have done more for astronomy just teaching school and thinking, than
all of you with your observatories and telescopes and cameras and
spaceships.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,&quot; said
Talliaferro, &quot;I'm pleased. More power to you. May I see a copy of the
paper?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, no.&quot;
Villiers' hands clenched close to his chest as though he were holding phantom
sheets and shielding them from observation. &quot;You wait like everyone else.
There's only one copy and no one will see it till I'm ready. Not even
Mandel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;One copy,&quot;
cried Talliaferro. &quot;If you misplace it—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I won't. And if
I do, it's all in my head.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If you—&quot;
Talliaferro almost finished that sentence with &quot;die&quot; but stopped
himself. Instead, he went on after an almost imperceptible pause, &quot;—have
any sense, you'll scan it at least. For safety's sake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No,&quot; said
Villiers, shortly. &quot;You'll hear me day after tomorrow. You'll see the
human horizon expanded at one stroke as it never has been before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Again he stared
intently at each face. &quot;Ten years,&quot; he said. &quot;Good-by.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He's mad,&quot;
said Ryger explosively, staring at the door as though Villiers were still
standing before it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Is he?&quot;
said Talliaferro thoughtfully. &quot;I suppose he is, in a way. He hates us for
irrational reasons. And, then, not even to scan his paper as a precaution—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro fingered
his own small scanner as he said that. It was just a neutrally colored,
undistinguished cylinder, somewhat thicker and somewhat shorter than an
ordinary pencil. In recent years, it had become the hallmark of the scientist,
much as the stethoscope was that of the physician and the micro-computer that
of the statistician. The scanner was worn in a jacket pocket, or clipped to a
sleeve, or slipped behind the ear, or swung at the end of a string.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro sometimes,
in his more philosophical moments, wondered how it was in the days when
research men had to make laborious notes of the literature or file away
full-sized reprints. How unwieldy!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Now it was only
necessary to scan anything printed or written to have a micro-negative which
could be developed at leisure. Talliaferro had already recorded every abstract
included in the program booklet of the Convention. The other two, he assumed
with full confidence, had done likewise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said,
&quot;Under the circumstances, refusal to scan is mad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Space!&quot;
said Ryger hotly. &quot;There is no paper. There is no discovery. Scoring one
on us would be worth any lie to him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But then what
will he do day after tomorrow?&quot; asked Kaunas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How do I know?
He's a madman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro still
played with his scanner and wondered idly if he ought to remove and develop
some of the small slivers of film that lay stored away in its vitals. He
decided against it. He said, &quot;Don't underestimate Villiers. He's a
brain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ten years ago,
maybe,&quot; said Ryger. &quot;Now he's a nut. I propose we forget him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He spoke loudly, as
though to drive away Villiers and all that concerned him by the sheer force
with which he discussed other things. He talked about Ceres and his work—the
radio-plotting of the Milky Way with new radioscopes capable of the resolution
of single stars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas listened and
nodded, then chimed in with information concerning the radio emissions of
sunspots and his own paper, in press, on the association of proton storms with
the gigantic hydrogen flares on the sun's surface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro contributed
little. Lunar work was unglamorous in comparison. The latest information on
long-scale weather forecasting through direct observation of terrestrial
jet-streams would not compare with radioscopes and proton storms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>More than that, his
thoughts could not leave Villiers. Villiers <i>was </i>the brain. They all knew
it. Even Ryger, for all his bluster, must feel that if mass-transference were
at all possible then Villiers was a logical discoverer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'> The discussion of
their own work amounted to no more than an uneasy admission that none of them
had come to much. Talliaferro had followed the literature and knew. His own
papers had been minor. The others had authored nothing of great importance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>None of them—face the
fact—had developed into space-shakers. The colossal dreams of school days had
not come true and that was that. They were competent routine workmen. No less.
Unfortunately, no more. They knew that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Villiers would have
been more. They knew that, too. It was that knowledge, as well as guilt, which
kept them antagonistic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro felt
uneasily that Villiers, despite everything, was yet to <i>be </i>more. The
others must be thinking so, too, and mediocrity could grow quickly unbearable.
The mass-transference paper would come to pass and Villiers would be the great
man after all, as he was always fated to be apparently, while his classmates,
with all their advantages, would be forgotten. Their role would be no more than
to applaud from the crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He felt his own envy
and chagrin and was ashamed of it, but felt it none the less.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Conversation died, and
Kaunas said, his eyes turning away, &quot;Listen, why don't we drop in on old
Villiers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a false
heartiness about it, a completely unconvincing effort at casualness. He added,
&quot;No use leaving bad feelings—unnecessarily—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro thought:
He wants to make sure about the mass-transference. He's hoping it <i>is </i>only
a madman's nightmare so he can sleep tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But he was curious
himself, so he made no objection, and even Ryger shrugged with ill grace and
said, &quot;Hell, why not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was a little before
eleven then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro was
awakened by the insistent ringing of his door signal. He hitched himself to one
elbow in the darkness and felt distinctly outraged. The soft glow of the
ceiling indicator showed it to be not quite four in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He cried out,
&quot;Who is it?&quot; The ringing continued in short, insistent spurts. Growling, 
Talliaferro  slipped   into  his  bathrobe.   He opened the door and blinked in
the corridor light. He recognized the man who faced him from the trimensionals
he had seen often enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Nevertheless, the man
said in an abrupt whisper, &quot;My name is Hubert Mandel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot;
said Talliaferro. Mandel was one of the Names in astronomy, prominent enough to
have an important executive position with the World Astronomical Bureau, active
enough to be Chairman of the Astronautics section here at the Convention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It suddenly struck
Talliaferro that it was Mandel for whom Villiers claimed to have demonstrated
mass-transference. The thought of Villiers was somehow a sobering one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said, &quot;You
are Dr. Edward Talliaferro?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then dress and
come with me. It is very important. It concerns a mutual acquaintance.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Dr.
Villiers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel's eyes
flickered a bit. His brows and lashes were so fair as to give those eyes a
naked, unfringed appearance. His hair was silky-thin, his age about fifty. He
said, &quot;Why Villiers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He mentioned you
last evening. I don't know any other mutual acquaintance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel nodded, waited
for Talliaferro to finish slipping into his clothes, then turned and led the
way. Ryger and Kaunas were waiting in a room one floor above Talliaferro's.
Kaunas's eyes were red and troubled. Ryger was smoking a cigarette with
impatient puffs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said,
&quot;We're all here. Another reunion.&quot; It fell flat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He took a seat and the
three stared at one another. Ryger shrugged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel paced the floor,
hands keep in his pockets. He said, &quot;I apologize for any inconvenience,
gentlemen, and I thank you for your co-operation. I would like more of it. Our
friend, Romero Villiers, is dead. About an hour ago, his body was removed from
the hotel. The medical judgment is heart failure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a stunned
silence. Ryger's cigarette hovered halfway to his lips, then sank slowly
without completing its journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Poor
devil,&quot; said Talliaferro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Horrible,&quot;
whispered Kaunas hoarsely. &quot;He was—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>His voice played out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger shook himself.
&quot;Well, he had a bad heart. There's nothing to be done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;One little
thing,&quot; corrected Mandel quietly. &quot;Recovery.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What does that
mean?&quot; asked Ryger sharply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said,
&quot;When did you three see him last?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro spoke.
&quot;Last evening. It turned out to be a reunion. We all met for the first
time in ten years. It wasn't a pleasant meeting, I'm sorry to say. Villiers
felt he had cause for anger with us, and he was angry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That
was—when?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;About nine, the
first time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The first time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We saw him again
later in the evening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas looked
troubled. &quot;He had left angrily. We couldn't leave it at that. We had to
try. It wasn't as if we hadn't all been friends at one time. So we went to his
room and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel pounced on
that. &quot;You were all in his room?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said
Kaunas, surprised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;About
when?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Eleven, I
think.&quot; He looked at the others. Talliaferro nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And how long did
you stay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Two
minutes,&quot; put in Ryger. &quot;He ordered us out as though we were after
his paper.&quot; He paused as though expecting Mandel to ask what paper, but
Mandel said nothing. He went on. &quot;I think he kept it under his pillow. At
least he lay across the pillow as he yelled at us to leave.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He may have been
dying then,&quot; said Kaunas, in a sick whisper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not then,&quot;
said Mandel shortly. &quot;So you probably all left fingerprints.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Probably,&quot;
said Talliaferro. He was losing some of his automatic respect for Mandel and a
sense of impatience was returning. It <i>was </i>four in the morning, Mandel or
no. He said, &quot;Now what's all this about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,
gentlemen,&quot; said Mandel, &quot;there's more to Villiers' death than the
fact of death. Villiers' paper, the only copy of it as far as I know, was
stuffed into the cigarette flash-disposal unit and only scraps of it were left.
I've never seen or read the paper, but I knew enough about the matter to be
willing to swear in court if necessary that the remnants of unflashed paper in
the disposal unit were of the paper he was planning to give at this Convention.
—You seem doubtful, Dr. Ryger.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger smiled sourly.
&quot;Doubtful that he was going to give it. If you want my opinion, sir, he
was mad. For ten years he was a prisoner of Earth and he fantasied
mass-transference as escape. It was all that kept him alive probably. He rigged
up some sort of fraudulent demonstration. I don't say it was deliberate fraud.
He was probably madly sincere, and sincerely mad. Last evening was the climax.
He came to our rooms—he hated us for having escaped Earth—and triumphed over
us. It was what he had lived for for ten years. It may have shocked him back to
some form of sanity. He knew he couldn't actually give the paper; there was
nothing to give. So he burnt it and his heart gave out. It <i>is </i>too
bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel listened to the
Cerian astronomer, wearing a look of sharp disapproval. He said, &quot;Very
glib, Dr. Ryger, but quite wrong. I am not as easily fooled by fraudulent
demonstrations as you may believe. Now according to the registration data,
which I have been forced to check rather hastily, you three were his classmates
at college. Is that right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are there any
other classmates of yours present at the Convention?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No,&quot; said
Kaunas. &quot;We were the only four qualifying for a doctorate in astronomy
that year. At least he would have qualified except—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, I
understand,&quot; said Mandel. &quot;Well, then, in that case one of you three
visited Villiers in his room one last time at midnight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a short
silence. Then Ryger said coldly, &quot;Not I.&quot; Kaunas, eyes wide, shook
his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said,
&quot;What are you implying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;One of you came
to him at midnight and insisted on seeing his paper. I don't know the motive.
Conceivably, it was with the deliberate intention of forcing him into heart
failure. When Villiers collapsed, the criminal, if I may call him so, was
ready. He snatched the paper which, I might add, probably <i>was </i>kept under
his pillow, and scanned it. Then he destroyed the paper itself in the
flash-disposal, but he was in a hurry and destruction wasn't complete.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger interrupted.
&quot;How do you know all this? Were you a witness?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Almost,&quot;
said Mandel. &quot;Villiers was not quite dead at the moment of his first
collapse. When the criminal left, he managed to reach the phone and call my
room. He choked out a few phrases, enough to outline what had occurred.
Unfortunately I was not in my room; a late conference kept me away. However, my
recording attachment taped it. I always play the recording tape back whenever I
return to my room or office. Bureaucratic habit. I called back. He was dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,
then,&quot; said Ryger, &quot;who did he say did it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He didn't. Or if
he did, it was unintelligible. But one word rang out clearly. It was
'classmate.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro detached
his scanner from its place in his inner jacket pocket and held it out toward
Mandel. Quietly he said, &quot;If you would like to develop the film in my
scanner, you are welcome to do so. You will not find Villiers' paper
there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>At once, Kaunas did
the same, and Ryger, with a scowl, joined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel took all three
scanners and said dryly, &quot;Presumably, whichever one of you has done this
has already disposed of the piece of exposed film with the paper on it. However—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro raised his
eyebrows. &quot;You may search my person or my room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Ryger was still
scowling, &quot;Now wait a minute, wait one bloody minute. Are you the
police?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel stared at him.
&quot;Do you <i>want </i>the police? Do you want a scandal and a murder charge?
Do you want the Convention disrupted and the System press to make a holiday out
of astronomy and astronomers? Villiers' death might well have been accidental.
He <i>did </i>have a bad heart. Whichever one of you was there may well have
acted on impulse. It may not have been a premeditated crime. If whoever it is
will return the negative, we can avoid a great deal of trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Even for the
criminal?&quot; asked Talliaferro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel shrugged.
&quot;There may be trouble for him. I will not promise immunity. But whatever
the trouble, it won't be public disgrace and life imprisonment, as it might be
if the police are called in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said, &quot;It
is one of you three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel went on,
&quot;I think I can see the original reasoning of the guilty person. The paper
would be destroyed. Only we four knew of the mass-transference and only I had
ever seen a demonstration. Moreover you had only his word, a madman's word
perhaps, that I had seen it. With Villiers dead of heart failure and the paper
gone, it would be easy to believe Dr. Ryger's theory that there was no
mass-transference and never had been. A year or two might pass and our
criminal, in possession of the mass-transference data, could reveal it little
by little, rig experiments, publish careful papers, and end as the apparent
discoverer with all that would imply in terms of money and renown. Even his own
classmates would suspect nothing. At most they would believe that the long-past
affair with Villiers had inspired him to begin investigations in the field. No
more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel looked sharply
from one face to another. &quot;But none of that will work now. Any of the
three of you who comes through with mass-transference is proclaiming himself
the criminal. I've seen the demonstration; I know it is legitimate; I know that
one of you possesses a record of the paper. The information is therefore useless
to you. Give it up then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel walked to the
door and turned again, &quot;I'd appreciate it if you would stay here till I
return. I won't be long. I hope the guilty one will use the interval to consider.
If he's afraid a confession will lose him his job, let him remember that a
session with the police may lose him his liberty <i>and </i>cost him the
Psychic Probe.&quot; He hefted the three scanners, looked grim and somewhat in
need of sleep. &quot;I'll develop these.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas tried to smile.
&quot;What if we make a break for it while you're gone?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Only one of you
has reason to try,&quot; said Mandel. &quot;I think I can rely on the two
innocent ones to control the third, if only out of self-protection.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He left</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was five in the
morning. Ryger looked at his watch indignantly. &quot;A hell of a thing. I want
to sleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We can curl up
here,&quot; said Talliaferro philosophically. &quot;Is anyone planning a
confession?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas looked away and
Ryger's lip lifted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I didn't think
so.&quot; Talliaferro closed his eyes, leaned his large head back against the
chair and said in a tired voice, &quot;Back on the Moon, they're in the slack
season. We've got a two-week night and then it's busy, busy. Then there's two
weeks of sun and there's nothing but calculations, correlations and bull-sessions.
That's the hard time. I hate it. If there were more women, if I could arrange
something permanent—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In a whisper, Kaunas
talked about the fact that it was still impossible to get the entire Sun above
the horizon and in view of the telescope on Mercury. But with another two miles
of track soon to be laid down for the Observatory—move the whole thing, you
know, tremendous forces involved, solar energy used directly—it might be
managed. It <i>would </i>be managed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Even Ryger consented
to talk of Ceres after listening to the low murmur of the other voices. There
was the problem there of the two-hour rotation period, which meant the stars
whipped across the sky at an angular velocity twelve times that in Earth's sky.
A net of three light scopes, three radio scopes, three of everything, caught
the fields of study from one another as they whirled past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Could you use
one of the poles?&quot; asked Kaunas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You're thinking
of Mercury and the Sun,&quot; said Ryger impatiently. &quot;Even at the poles,
the sky would still twist, and half of it would be forever bidden. Now if Ceres
showed only one face to the Sun, the way Mercury does, we could have a
permanent night sky with the stars rotating slowly once in three years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The sky lightened and
it dawned slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro was half
asleep, but he kept hold of half-consciousness firmly. He would not fall asleep
and leave the others awake. Each of the three, he thought, was wondering,
&quot;Who? Who?&quot;—except the guilty one, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro's eyes
snapped open as Mandel entered again. The sky, as seen from the window, had
grown blue. Talliaferro was glad the window was closed. The hotel was
air-conditioned, of course, but windows could be opened during the mild season
of the year by those Earth-men who fancied the illusion of fresh air.
Talliaferro, with Moon-vacuum on his mind, shuddered at the thought with real
discomfort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said,
&quot;Have any of you anything to say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They looked at him
steadily. Ryger shook his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said, &quot;I
have developed the film in your scanners, gentlemen, and viewed the
results.&quot; He tossed scanners and developed slivers of film on to the bed.
&quot;Nothing! you'll have trouble sorting out the film, I'm afraid. For that
I'm sorry. And now there is still the question of the missing film.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If any,&quot;
said Ryger, and yawned prodigiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said, &quot;I
would suggest we come down to Villiers' room, gentlemen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas looked
startled. &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said,
&quot;Is this psychology? Bring the criminal to the scene of the crime and
remorse will wring a confession from him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said, &quot;A
less melodramatic reason is that I would like to have the two of you who are
innocent help me find the missing film of Villiers' paper.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you think
it's there?&quot; asked Ryger challengingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Possibly. It's a
beginning. We can then search each of your rooms. The symposium on Astronautics
doesn't start till tomorrow at 10 <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>a.m. </span>We
have till then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And after
that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It may have to
be the police.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They stepped gingerly
into Villiers' room. Ryger was red, Kaunas pale. Talliaferro tried to remain
calm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Last night they had
seen it under artificial lighting with a scowling, disheveled Villiers
clutching his pillow, staring them down, ordering them away. Now there was the
scentless odor of death about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel fiddled with
the window-polarizer to let more light in, and adjusted it too far, so that the
eastern Sun slipped in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas threw his arm
up to shade his eyes and screamed, &quot;The Sun!&quot; so that all the others
froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas's face showed a
kind of terror, as though it were his Mercurian sun that he had caught a blinding
glimpse of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro thought of
his own reaction to the possibility of open air and his teeth gritted. They
were all bent crooked by their ten years away from Earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas ran to the
window, fumbling for the polarizer, and then the breath came out of him in a
huge gasp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel stepped to his
side. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; and the other two joined them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The city lay stretched
below them and outward to the horizon in broken stone and brick, bathed in the
rising sun, with the shadowed portions toward them. Talliaferro cast it all a
furtive and uneasy glance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas, his chest
seemingly contracted past the point where he could cry out, stared at something
much closer. There, on the outer window sill, one corner secured in a trifling
imperfection, a crack in the cement, was an inch-long strip of milky-gray film,
and on it were the early rays of the rising sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel, with an angry,
incoherent cry, threw up the window and snatched it away. He shielded it in one
cupped hand, staring out of hot and reddened eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Wait
here!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was nothing to
say. When Mandel left, they sat down and stared stupidly at one another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel was back in twenty
minutes. He said quietly (in a voice that gave the impression, somehow, that it
was quiet only because its owner had passed far beyond the raving stage),
&quot;The corner in the crack wasn't overexposed. I could make out a few words.
It is Villiers' paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The rest is ruined;
nothing can be salvaged. It's gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What next?&quot;
said Talliaferro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel shrugged
wearily. &quot;Right now, I don't care. Mass-transference is gone until someone
as brilliant as Villiers works it out again. I shall work on it but I have no
illusions as to my own capacity. With it gone, I suppose you three don't
matter, guilty or not. What's the difference?&quot; His whole body seemed to
have loosened and sunk into despair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Talliaferro's
voice grew hard. &quot;Now, hold on. In your eyes, any of the three of us might
be guilty. I, for instance. You are a big man in the field and you will never
have a good word to say for me. The general idea may arise that I am
incompetent or worse. I will not be ruined by the shadow of guilt. Now let's
solve this thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I am no
detective,&quot; said Mandel wearily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then call in the
police, damn it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger said, &quot;Wait
a while, Tal. Are you implying that I'm guilty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm saying that
I'm innocent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas raised his
voice in fright. &quot;It will mean the Psychic Probe for each of us. There may
be mental damage—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel raised both
arms high in the air. &quot;Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Please! There is one thing we
might do short of the police; and you are right, Dr. Talliaferro, it would be
unfair to the innocent to leave this matter here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They turned to him in
various stages of hostility. Ryger said, &quot;What do you suggest?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I have a friend
named Wendell Urth. You may have heard of him, or you may not, but perhaps I
can arrange to see him tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What if you
can?&quot; demanded Talliaferro. &quot;Where does that get us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He's an odd
man,&quot; said Mandel hesitantly, &quot;very odd. And very brilliant in his
way. He has helped the police before this and he may be able to help us
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Edward Talliaferro
could not forbear staring at the room and its occupant with the greatest
astonishment. It and he seemed to exist in isolation, and to be part of no
recognizable world. The sounds of Earth were absent in this well-padded,
windowless nest. The light and air of Earth had been blanked out in artificial
illumination and conditioning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was a large room,
dim and cluttered. They had picked their way across a littered floor to a couch
from which book-films had been brusquely cleared and dumped to one side in a
tangle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The man who owned the
room had a large, round face on a stumpy, round body. He moved quickly about on
his short legs, jerking his head as he spoke until his thick glasses all but
bounced off the thoroughly inconspicuous nubble that served as a nose. His
thick-lidded, somewhat protuberant eyes gleamed in myopic good nature at them
all, as he seated himself in his own chair-desk combination, lit directly by
the one bright light hi the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So good of you
to come, gentlemen. Pray excuse the condition of my room.&quot; He waved stubby
fingers in a wide-sweeping gesture. &quot;I am engaged in cataloguing the many
objects of extraterrological interest I have accumulated. It is a tremendous
job. For instance—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He dodged out of his
seat and burrowed in a heap of objects beside the desk till he came up with a
smoky-gray object, semi-translucent and roughly cylindrical. &quot;This,&quot;
he said, &quot;is a Callistan object that may be a relic of intelligent
nonhuman entities. It is not decided. Not more than a dozen have been
discovered and this is the most perfect single specimen I know of.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He tossed it to one
side and Talliaferro jumped. The plump man stared in his direction and said,
&quot;It's not breakable.&quot; He sat down again, clasped his pudgy fingers
tightly over his abdomen and let them pump slowly in and out as he breathed.
&quot;And now what can I do for you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hubert Mandel had
carried through the introductions and Talliaferro was considering deeply.
Surely it was a man named Wendell Urth who had written a recent book entitled <i>Comparative
Evolutionary Processes on Water-Oxygen Planets, </i>and surely this could not
be the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He bounced out of his

This is serious.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He virtually forced
Urth back into his chair and began speaking rapidly as though to prevent any
further side issues from erupting. He told the whole story with admirable
word-economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth reddened slowly
as he listened. He seized his glasses and shoved them higher up on his nose.
&quot;Mass-transference!&quot; he cried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I saw it with my

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you never

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I was sworn to
secrecy. The man was—peculiar. I explained that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth pounded the desk.
&quot;How could you allow such a discovery to remain the property of an
eccentric, Mandel? The knowledge should have been forced from him by Psychic
Probe, if necessary.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It would have
killed him,&quot; protested Mandel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Urth was rocking
back and forth with his hands clasped tightly to his cheeks.
&quot;Mass-transference. The only way a decent, civilized man should travel.
The only possible way. The only conceivable way. If I had known. If I could
have been there. But the hotel is nearly thirty miles away.&quot;</span></p>

there in ten minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth stiffened and
looked at Ryger strangely. His cheeks bulged. He jumped to his feet and
scurried out of the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel muttered,
&quot;Damn it. I should have warned you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

foot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas blinked about
in the dimness. &quot;But he's an extraterrologist, isn't he? An expert on life

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro had risen
and now stood before a Galactic Lens on a pedestal. He stared at the inner

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said,
&quot;He's an extraterrologist, yes, but he's never visited any of the planets

been more than a mile from this room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

angrily. &quot;You may find it funny, but I'd appreciate your being careful
what you say when Dr. Urth comes back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth sidled in a
moment later. &quot;My apologies, gentlemen,&quot; he said in a whisper.
&quot;And now let us approach our problem. Perhaps one of you wishes to
confess.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro's lips
quirked sourly. This plump, self-imprisoned extraterrologist was scarcely
formidable enough to force a confession from anyone. Fortunately, there would
be no need of his detective talents, if any, after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said,
&quot;Dr. Urth, are you connected with the police?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A certain smugness
seemed to suffuse Urth's ruddy face. &quot;I have no official connection, Dr.
Talliaferro, but my unofficial relationships are very good indeed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In that case, I
will give you some information which you can carry to the police.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth drew in his
abdomen and hitched at his shirttail. It came free, and slowly he polished his
glasses with it. When he was quite through and had perched them precariously On
his nose once more, he said, &quot;And what is that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I will tell you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I've thought
about it all day. I think I've solved it.&quot; Talliaferro rather enjoyed the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,
then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro took a
deep breath. This was not going to be easy to do, though he had been planning
it for hours. &quot;The guilty man,&quot; he said, &quot;is obviously Dr.
Hubert Mandel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel stared at
Talliaferro in sudden, hard-breathing indignation. &quot;Look here,
Doctor,&quot; he began, loudly, &quot;if you have any basis for such a
ridiculous—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth's tenor voice
soared above the interruption. &quot;Let him talk, Hubert, let us hear him. You
suspected him and there is no law that forbids him to suspect you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel fell angrily
silent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro, not
allowing his voice to falter, said, &quot;It is more than just suspicion, Dr.
Urth. The evidence is perfectly plain. Four of us knew about mass-transference,
but only one of us, Dr. Mandel, had actually seen a demonstration. He <i>knew </i>it
to be a fact. He <i>knew </i>a paper on the subject existed. We three knew only
that Villiers was more or less unbalanced. Oh, we might have thought there was
just a chance. We visited him at eleven, I think, just to check on that, though
none of us actually said so—but he just acted crazier than ever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Check special
knowledge and motive then on Dr. Mandel's side. Now, Dr. Urth, picture
something else. Whoever it was who confronted Villiers at midnight, saw him
collapse, and scanned his paper (let's keep him anonymous for a<i> </i>moment)
must have been terribly startled to see Villiers apparently come to life again
and to hear him talking into the telephone. Our criminal, in the panic of the
moment, realized one thing: he must get rid of the one piece of incriminating
material evidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He had to get
rid of the undeveloped film of the paper and he had to do it in such a way that
it would be safe from discovery so that he might pick it up once more if he
remained unsuspected. The outer window sill was ideal. Quickly he threw up Villiers'
window, placed the strip of film outside, and left. Now, even if Villiers
survived or if his telephoning brought results, it would be merely Villiers'
word against his own and it would be easy to show that Villiers was
unbalanced.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro paused in
something like triumph. This would be irrefutable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Wendell Urth blinked
at him and wiggled the thumbs of his clasped hands so that they slapped against
his ample shirt front. He said, &quot;And the significance of all that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The significance
is that the window was thrown open and the film placed in open air. Now Ryger
has lived for ten years on Ceres, Kaunas on Mercury, I on the Moon— barring
short leaves and not many of them. We commented to one another several times
yesterday on the difficulty of growing acclimated to Earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>, &quot;Our
work-worlds are each airless objects. We never go out in the open without a
suit. To expose ourselves to unenclosed space is unthinkable. None of us could
have opened the window without a severe inner struggle. Dr. Mandel, however,
has lived on Earth exclusively. Opening a window to him is only a matter of a
bit of muscular exertion. He could do it. We couldn't. Ergo, he did it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro sat back
and smiled a bit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Space, that's
it!&quot; cried Ryger, with enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's not it at
all,&quot; roared Mandel, half rising as though tempted to throw himself at
Talliaferro. &quot;I deny the whole miserable fabrication. What about the
record I have of Villiers' phone call? He used the word 'classmate.' The entire
tape makes it obvious—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He was a dying
man,&quot; said Talliaferro. &quot;Much of what he said you admitted was
incomprehensible. I ask you, Dr. Mandel, without having heard the tape, if it
isn't true that Villiers' voice is distorted past recognition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well—&quot; said
Mandel in confusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm sure it is.
There is no reason to suppose, then, that you might not have rigged up the tape
in advance, complete with the damning word 'classmate.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said,
&quot;Good Lord, how would I know there were classmates at the Convention? How
would I know they knew about the mass-transference?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Villiers might
have told you. I presume he did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now, look,&quot;
said Mandel, &quot;you three saw Villiers alive at eleven. The medical
examiner, seeing Villiers' body shortly after 3 <span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>a.m. </span>declared he had been dead at least two hours. That was
certain. The time of death, therefore, was between 11 <span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>p.m. </span>and 1 <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>a.m. </span>I
was at a late conference last night. I can prove my whereabouts, miles from the
hotel, between 10:00 and 2:00 by a dozen witnesses no one of whom anyone can
possibly question. Is that enough for you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro paused a
moment. Then he went on stubbornly, &quot;Even so. Suppose you got back to the
hotel by 2:30. You went to Villiers' room to discuss his talk. You found the
door open, or you had a duplicate key. Anyway, you found him dead. You seized
the opportunity to scan the paper—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And if he were
already dead, and couldn't make phone calls, why should I hide the film?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;To remove
suspicion. You may have a second copy of the film safe in your possession. For
that matter, we have only your own word that the paper itself was
destroyed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Enough.
Enough,&quot; cried Urth. &quot;It is an interesting hypothesis, Dr.
Talliaferro, but it falls to the ground of its own weight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro frowned.
&quot;That's your opinion, perhaps—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It would be
anyone's opinion. Anyone, that is, with the power of human thought. Don't you
see that Hubert Mandel did too much to be the criminal?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No,&quot; said
Talliaferro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Wendell Urth smiled
benignly. &quot;As a scientist, Dr. Talliaferro, you undoubtedly know better than
to fall in love with your own theories to the exclusion of facts or reasoning.
Do me the pleasure of behaving similarly as a detective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Consider that if
Dr. Mandel had brought about the death of Villiers and faked an alibi, or if he
had found Villiers dead and taken advantage of that, how little he would really
have had to do! Why scan the paper or even pretend that anyone had done so? He
could simply have taken the paper. Who else knew of its existence? Nobody,
really. There is no reason to think Villiers told anyone else about it.
Villiers was pathologically secretive. There would have been every reason to
think that he told no one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No one knew
Villiers was giving a talk, except Dr. Mandel. It wasn't announced. No abstract
was published. Dr. Mandel could have walked off with the paper in perfect
confidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Even if he had
discovered that Villiers had talked to his classmates about the matter, what of
it? What evidence would his classmates have except the word of one whom they
are themselves half willing to consider a madman?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;By announcing
instead that Villiers' paper had been destroyed, by declaring his death to be
not entirely natural, by searching for a scanned copy of the film—in short by
everything Dr. Mandel has done—he has aroused a suspicion that only he could
possibly have aroused when he need only have remained quiet to have committed a
perfect crime. If he were the criminal, he would be more stupid, more
colossally obtuse than anyone I have ever known. And Dr. Mandel, after all, is
none of that.&quot;</span></p>

obvious, too. I knew which of you was guilty the moment Dr. Mandel had completed

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro stared at
the plump extraterrologist with distaste. The bluff did not frighten him, but
it was affecting the other two. Ryger's lips were thrust out and Kaunas's lower

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth said at once,
&quot;No need to be afraid of the Probe. Proper handling is safe, particularly
if a man offers himself voluntarily. When damage is done, it is usually because
of unnecessary resistance, a kind of mental tearing, you know. So if the guilty
man will voluntarily confess, place himself in my hands—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro laughed.
The sudden noise rang out sharply in the dim quiet of the room. The psychology
was so transparent and artless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Wendell Urth looked
almost bewildered at the reaction and stared earnestly at Talliaferro over his
glasses. He said, &quot;I have enough influence with the police to keep the
Probing entirely confidential.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ryger said savagely, &quot;I
didn't do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas shook his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro disdained
any answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth sighed.
&quot;Then I will have to point out the guilty man. It will be traumatic. It
will make things harder.&quot; He tightened the grip on his belly and his
fingers twitched. &quot;Dr. Talliaferro pointed out that the film was hidden on
the outer window sill so that it might remain safe from discovery and from
harm. I agree with him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
said Talliaferro dryly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;However, why
should anyone think that an outer window sill is a particularly safe hiding
place? The police would certainly look there. Even in the absence of the police
it was discovered. Who would tend to consider anything outside a building as particularly
safe? Obviously, some person who has lived a long time on an airless world and
has it drilled into him that no one goes outside an enclosed place without
detailed precautions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>'To someone on the
Moon, for instance, anything hidden outside a Lunar Dome would be comparatively
safe. Men venture out only rarely and then only on specific business. So he
would overcome the hardship of opening a window and exposing himself to what he
would subconsciously consider a vacuum for the sake of a safe hiding place. The
reflex thought, 'Outside an inhabited structure is safe,&quot; would do the
trick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro said
between clenched teeth, &quot;Why do you mention the Moon, Dr. Urth?&quot; ,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth said blandly,
&quot;Only as an example. What I've said so far applies to all three of you.
But now comes the crucial point, the matter of the dying night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Talliaferro frowned.
&quot;You mean the night Villiers died?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I mean any
night. See here, even granted that an outer window sill was a safe hiding
place, which of you would be mad enough to consider it a safe hiding place <i>for
a piece of unexposed film? </i>Scanner film isn't very sensitive, to be sure,
and is made to be developed under all sorts of hit-and-miss conditions. Diffuse
night-time illumination wouldn't seriously affect it, but diffuse daylight
would ruin it in a few minutes, and direct sunlight would ruin it at once.
Everyone knows that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel said, &quot;Go
ahead, Urth. What is this leading to?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You're trying to
rush me,&quot; said Urth, with a massive pout. &quot;I want you to see this
clearly. The criminal wanted, above all, to keep the film safe. It was his only
record of something of supreme value to himself and to the world. Why would he
put it where it would inevitably be ruined by the morning sun?—Only because he
did not expect the morning sun ever to come. He thought the night, so to speak,
was immortal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But nights <i>aren't
</i>immortal. On Earth, they die and give way to daytime. Even the six-month
polar night is a dying night eventually. The nights on Ceres last only two
hours; the nights on the Moon last two weeks. They are dying nights, too, and
Dr. Talliaferro and Ryger know that day must always come.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas was on his
feet. &quot;But wait—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Wendell Urth faced him
full. &quot;No longer any need to wait, Dr. Kaunas. Mercury is the only sizable
object in the Solar System that turns only one face to the sun. Even taking
libration into account, fully three-eighths of its surface is true dark-side
and never sees the sun. The Polar Observatory is at the rim of that dark-side.
For ten years, you have grown used to the fact that nights are immortal, that a
surface in darkness remains eternally in darkness, and so you entrusted unexposed
film to Earth's night, forgetting in your excitement that nights must die—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas stumbled
forward. &quot;Wait—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth was inexorable.
&quot;I am told that when Mandel adjusted the polarizer in Villiers' room, you
screamed at the sunlight. Was that your ingrained fear of Mercurian sun, or
your sudden realization of what sunlight meant to your plans? You rushed
forward. Was that to adjust the polarizer or to stare at the ruined film?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kaunas fell to his
knees. &quot;I didn't mean it. I wanted to speak to him, only to speak to him,
and he screamed and collapsed. I thought he was dead and the paper was under
his pillow and it all just followed. One thing led on to another and before I
knew it, I couldn't get out of it anymore. But I meant none of it. I swear
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They had formed a
semicircle about him and Wendell Urth stared at the moaning Kaunas with pity in
his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>An ambulance had come
and gone. Talliaferro finally brought himself to say stiffly to Mandel, &quot;I
hope, sir, there will be no hard feelings for anything said here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And Mandel had
answered, as stiffly, &quot;I think we had all better forget as much as
possible of what has happened during the last twenty-four hours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were standing in
the doorway, ready to leave, and Wendell Urth ducked his smiling head, and
said, &quot;There's the question of my fee, you know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel looked
startled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not money,&quot;
said Urth at once. &quot;But when the first mass-transference setup for humans
is established, I want a trip arranged for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandel continued to
look anxious. &quot;Now, wait. Trips through outer space are a long way
off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth shook his head
rapidly. &quot;Not outer space. Not at all. I would like to step across to
Lower Falls, New Hampshire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right. But
why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth looked up. To
Talliaferro's outright surprise, the extra-terrologist's face wore an
expression compounded of shyness and eagerness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Urth said, &quot;I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It worked itself out, to begin with, like a
dream. I didn't have to make any arrangement. I didn't have to touch it. I just
watched things work out. —Maybe that's when I should have first smelled
catastrophe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It began with my usual
month's layoff between assignments. A month on and a month off is the right and
proper routine for the Galactic Service. I reached Marsport for the usual
three-day layover before the short hop to Earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ordinarily, Hilda, God
bless her, as sweet a wife as any man ever had, would be there waiting for me
and we'd have a nice sedate time of it—a nice little interlude for the two of
us. The only trouble with that is that Marsport is the rowdiest spot in the
System, and a nice little interlude isn't exactly what fits in. Only, how do I
explain that to Hilda, hey?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Well, <i>this </i>time,
my mother-in-law, God <i>bless </i>her (for a change) got sick just two days
before I reached Marsport, and the night before landing, I got a spacegram from
Hilda saying she would stay on Earth with her mother and wouldn't meet me this
one time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I 'grammed back my

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That was still
nothing, you understand. It was the frame of the picture, the bones of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So I called up Flora

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I was giving myself

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

expensive of course, but if you've ever held a girl in your arms at 0.4 gees,
you need no explanation. If you haven't, explanations will do no good. I'm also

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

the bald head of that lousy Rog Crinton of the Mars offices, gleaming over a

long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;All
right,&quot; but she said it kind of like it was just enough not all right so
that I got the shivers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I stepped out of the
booth and said, &quot;All right, Rog, what kind of mess have you cooked up for
me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>We went into the
spaceport bar and got us an insulated booth. He said, &quot;The <i>Antares
Giant </i>is coming in from Sirius in exactly half an hour; at 8 <span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>p.m. </span>local time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Three men will
get out, among others, and will wait for the <i>Space Eater </i>coming in from
Earth at 11 <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>p.m. </span>and leaving for
Capella some time thereafter. The three men will get on the <i>Space Eater </i>and
will then be out of our jurisdiction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So between 8:00
and 11:00, they will be in a special waiting room and you will be with them. I
have a trimensional image of each for you so you'll know which they are and
which is which. You have between 8:00 and 11:00 to decide which one of the
three is carrying contraband.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What kind of
contraband?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The worst kind.
Altered Spaceoline.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Altered </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Spaceoline?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He had thrown me. I
knew what Spaceoline was. If you've been on a space-hop you know, too. And in
case you're Earth-bound yourself the bare fact is that everyone needs it on the
first space-trip; almost everybody needs it for the first dozen trips; lots
need it every trip. Without it, there is vertigo associated with free fall,
screaming terrors, semi-permanent psychoses. With it, there is nothing; no one
minds a thing. And it isn't habit-forming; it has no adverse side-effects.
Spaceoline is ideal, essential, unsubstitutable. When in doubt, take
Spaceoline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Rog said, &quot;That's
right, altered Spaceoline. It can be changed chemically by a very simple
reaction that can be conducted in anyone's basement into a drug that will give
one giant-size charge and become your baby-blue habit the first time. It is on
a par with the most dangerous alkaloids we know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And we just
found out about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No. The Service
has known about it for years, and we've kept others from knowing by squashing
every discovery flat. Only now the discovery has gone too far.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In what
way?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;One of the men
who will be stopping over at this spaceport is carrying some of the altered
Spaceoline on his person. Chemists in the Capellan system, which is outside the
Federation, will analyze it and set up ways of synthesizing more. After that,
it's either fight the worst drug menace we've ever seen or suppress the matter
by suppressing the source.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean
Spaceoline.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Right. And if we
suppress Spaceoline, we suppress space travel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I decided to put my
finger on the point. &quot;Which one of the three has it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Rog smiled nastily,
&quot;If we knew, would we need you? You're to find out which of the
three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You're calling
on me for a lousy frisk job.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Touch the wrong
one at the risk of a haircut down to the larynx. Every one of the three is a
big man on his own planet. One is Edward Harponaster; one is Joaquin Lipsky;
and one is Andiamo Ferrucci. Well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was right. I'd
heard of every one of them. Chances are you have, too; and not one was
touchable without proof in advance, as you know. I said, &quot;Would one of
them touch a dirty deal like—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;There are
trillions involved,&quot; said Rog, &quot;which means any one of the three
would. And one of them <i>is, </i>because Jack Hawk got that far before he was
killed—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Jack Hawk's <i>dead?&quot;
</i>For a minute, I forgot about the Galactic drug menace. For a minute, I
nearly forgot about Flora.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Right, and one
of those guys arranged the killing. Now you find out which. You put the finger
on the right one before 11:00 and there's a promotion, a raise in pay, a
pay-back for poor Jack Hawk, and a rescue of the Galaxy. You put the finger on
the wrong one and there'll be a nasty interstellar situation and you'll be out
on your ear and also on every black list from here to Antares and back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said, &quot;Suppose
I don't finger anybody?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That would be
like fingering the wrong one as far as the Service is concerned.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I've got to
finger someone but only the right one or my head's handed to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In thin slices.
You're beginning to understand me, Max.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In a long lifetime of
looking ugly, Rog Crinton had never looked uglier. The only comfort I got out
of staring at him was the realization that he was married, too, and that he
lived with his wife at Marsport all year round. And does he deserve that. Maybe
I'm hard on him, but he <i>deserves </i>it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I put in a quick call
to Flora, as soon as Rog was out of sight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said,
&quot;Well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said, &quot;Baby,
honey, it's something I can't talk about, but I've got to do it, see? Now you
hang on, I'll get it over with if I have to swim the Grand Canal to the icecap
in my underwear, see? If I have to claw Phobos out of the sky. If I have to cut
myself in pieces and mail myself parcel post.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Gee,&quot; she
said, &quot;if I thought I was going to have to wait—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I winced. She just
wasn't the type to respond to poetry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Actually, she was a
simple creature of action—But after all, if I was going to be drifting through
low-gravity in a sea of jasmine perfume with Flora, poetry-response is not the
type of qualification I would consider most indispensable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said urgently,
&quot;Just hold on, Flora. I won't be any time at all. I'll make it up to
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I was annoyed, sure,
but I wasn't worried as yet. Rog hadn't more than left me when I figured out
exactly how I was going to tell the guilty man from the others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was easy. I should
have called Rog back and told him, but there's no law against wanting egg in
your beer and oxygen in your air. It would take me five minutes and then off I
would go to Flora; a little late, maybe, but with a promotion, a raise, and a
slobbering kiss from the Service on each cheek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>You see, it's like
this. Big industrialists don't go space-hopping much; they use trans-video
reception. When they do go to some ultra-high interstellar conference, as these
three were probably going, they take Spaceoline. For one thing, they don't have
enough hops under their belt to risk doing without. For another, Spaceoline is
the expensive way of doing it and industrialists do things the expensive way. I
know their psychology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Now that would hold
for two of them. The one who carried contraband, however, couldn't risk
Spaceoline— even to prevent space-sickness. Under Spaceoline influence, he
could throw the drug away; or give it away; or talk gibberish about it. He
would <i>have </i>to stay in control of himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was as simple as
that, so I waited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The <i>Antares Giant </i>was
on time and I waited with my leg muscles tense for a quick take-off as soon as
I collared the murdering drug-toting rat and sped the two eminent captains of
industry on their way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They brought in Lipsky
first. He had thick, ruddy lips, rounded jowls, very dark eyebrows, and graying
hair. He just looked at me and sat down. Nothing. He was under Spaceoline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said, &quot;Good
evening, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, in a dreamy
voice, &quot;Surrealismus of Panamy hearts in three-quarter time for a cup of
coffeedom of speech.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That was Spaceoline all
the way. The buttons in the human mind were set free-swing. Each syllable
suggests the next in free association.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Andiamo Ferrucci came
in next. Black mustache, long and waxed, olive complexion, pock-marked face. He
took a seat in another chair, facing us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said, &quot;Nice
trip?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Trip
the light fantastic tock the clock is crowings on the bird.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Lipsky said,
&quot;Bird to the wise guyed book to all places every body.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I grinned. That left
Harponaster. I had my needle gun neatly palmed out of sight and the magnetic
coil ready to grip him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And then Harponaster
came in. He was thin, leathery, near-bald and rather younger than he seemed in
his trimensional image. And he was Spaceolined to the gills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said,
&quot;Damn!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Harponaster said,
&quot;Damyankee note speech to his last time I saw wood you say so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ferrucci said,
&quot;Sow the seed the territory under dispute do well to come along long road
to a nightingale.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Lipsky said, &quot;Gay
lords hopping pong balls.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I stared from one to
the other as the nonsense ran down in shorter and shorter spurts and then
silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I got the picture, all
right. One of them was faking. He had thought ahead and realized that omitting
the Spaceoline would be a giveaway. He might have bribed an official into
injecting saline or dodged it some other way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>One of them must be
faking. It wasn't hard to fake the thing. Comedians on sub-etheric had a
Spaceoline skit regularly. <i>You've </i>heard them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I stared at them and
got the first prickle at the base of my skull that said: What if you <i>don't </i>finger
the right one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was 8:30 and there
was my job, my reputation, my head growing rickety upon my neck to be
considered. I saved it all for later and thought of Flora. She wasn't going to
wait for me forever. For that matter, chances were she wouldn't wait for half an
hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I wondered. Could the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I tried a few more
times and got nowhere. The faker, whichever he was, had practiced or had
natural talents at talking free association. He was disconnecting his brain and
letting the words come out any old way. And he must be inspired by knowing
exactly what I was after. If &quot;drug&quot; hadn't given it away,
&quot;space-line&quot; three times repeated must have. I was safe with the
other two, but <i>he </i>would know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>—And he was having fun
with me. All three were saying phrases that might have pointed to a deep inner
guilt (&quot;sol to be saved,&quot; &quot;little black sheepishion of
wrong,&quot; &quot;drug from underneath,&quot; and so on). Two were saying such
things helplessly, randomly. The third was amusing himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So how did I find the
third? I was in a feverish thrill of hatred against him and my fingers
twitched. The rat was subverting the Galaxy. More than that, he had killed my
colleague and friend. More than that, he was keeping me from Flora.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I could go up to each
of them and start searching. The two who were really under Spaceoline would
make no move to stop me. They could feel no emotion, no fear, no anxiety, no
hate, no passion, no desire for self-defense. And if one made the slightest
gesture of resistance I would have my man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But the innocent ones
would remember afterward. They would remember a personal search while under
Spaceoline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I sighed. If I tried
it, I would get the criminal all right but later I would be the nearest thing
to chopped liver any man had ever been. There would be a shake-up in the
Service, a big stink the width of the Galaxy, and in the excitement and
disorganization, the secret of altered Spaceoline would get out anyway and so what
the hell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Of course, the one I
wanted might be the first one I touched. One chance out of three. I'd have one
out and only God can make a three.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I stared desperately

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I had no choice. I
made my way to the booth for another quick call to Flora. Just a quick one, you
understand, to keep things alive; assuming they weren't dead already.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I kept saying to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I tried to prepare

Marsport, I never would have had Flora on my mind in the first place and it
wouldn't have mattered. <i>But I was in Marsport without Hilda </i>and I had
made a date with Flora.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The signal was

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Answer! Answer!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She answered. She
said, &quot;It's <i>you!&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Lots of people.
Someone who would <i>come.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;There's just
this little detail of business, honey.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What business?
Plastons for who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I almost corrected her
grammar but I was too busy wondering what this plastons kick was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then I remembered. I
told her once I was a plaston salesman. That was the time I brought her a
plaston nightgown that was a honey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said, &quot;Look.
Just give me another half hour—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Her eyes grew moist.
&quot;I'm sitting here all by myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'll make it up
to you.&quot; To show you how desperate I was getting, I was definitely
beginning to think along paths that could lead only to jewelry even though a
sizable dent in the bankbook would show up to Hilda's piercing eye like the
Horsehead Nebula interrupting the Milky Way. But then I was desperate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;I had
a perfectly good date and I broke it off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I protested, &quot;You
said it was a quibbling little arrangement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That was a mistake. I
knew it the minute I said it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She shrieked, <i>&quot;Quibbling
little arrangement!&quot; </i>(It was what she had said. It was what she had
said. But having the truth on your side just makes it worse in arguing with a
woman. Don't I know?) &quot;You call a man who's promised me an estate on
Earth—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She went on and on
about that estate on Earth. There wasn't a gal in Marsport who wasn't wangling
for an estate on Earth, and you could count the number who got one on the sixth
finger of either hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I tried to stop her.
No use.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She finally said,
&quot;And here I am all alone, with <i>nobody,&quot; </i>and broke off contact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Well, she was right. I
felt like the lowest heel in the Galaxy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I went back into the
reception room. A flunky outside the door saluted me in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I stared at the three
industrialists and speculated on the order in which I would slowly choke each
to death if I could but receive choking orders. Harponaster first, maybe. He
had a thin, stringy neck that the fingers could go round neatly and a sharp
Adam's apple against which the thumbs could find purchase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It cheered me up
infinitesimally, to the point where I mustered, &quot;Boy!&quot; just out of
sheer longing, though it was no boy I was longing for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It started them off at
once. Ferrucci said, &quot;Boyl the watern the spout you goateeming rain over
us, God savior pennies—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Harponaster of the
scrawny neck added, &quot;Nies and nephew don't like orporalley cat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Lipsky said,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They stared at me. I
stared at them. They were empty of emotion (or two were) and I was empty of
ideas. And time passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I stared at them some
more and thought about Flora. It occurred to me that I had nothing to lose that
I had not already lost. I might as well talk about her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said,
&quot;Gentlemen, there is a girl in this town whose name I will not mention for
fear of compromising her. Let me describe her to you, gentlemen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And I did. If I say so
myself, the last two hours had honed me to such a fine force-field edge that
the description of Flora took on a kind of poetry that seemed to be coming from
some wellspring of masculine force deep in the subbasement of my unconscious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And they sat frozen,
almost as though they were listening, and hardly ever interrupting. People
under Spaceoline have a kind of politeness about them. They won't speak when
someone else is speaking. That's why they take turns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I kept it up with a
kind of heartfelt sadness in my voice until the loud-speaker announced in
stirring tones the arrival of the <i>Space Eater.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That was that. I said
in a loud voice, &quot;Rise, gentlemen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not you, you
murderer,&quot; and my magnetic coil was on Ferrucci's wrist before he could
breathe twice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ferrucci fought like a
demon. He was under no Spaceoline influence. They found the altered Spaceoline
in thin flesh-colored plastic pads hugging the inner surface of his thighs. You
couldn't see it at all; you could only feel it, and even then it took a knife
to make sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Afterward, Rog
Crinton, grinning and half insane with relief, held me by the lapel with a
death grip. &quot;How did you do it? What gave it away?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I said, trying to pull
loose, &quot;One of them was faking a Spaceoline jag. I was sure of it. So I
told them,&quot; (I grew cautious—none of his business as to the details, you
know) &quot;... uh, about a girl, see, and two of them never reacted, so they
were Spaceolined. But Ferrucci's breathing speeded up and the beads of sweat
came out on his forehead. I gave a pretty dramatic rendition, and he reacted,
so he was under no Spaceoline. Now will you let me go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He let go and I almost
fell over backward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I was set to take off.
My feet were pawing the ground without any instruction from me—but then I
turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Hey, Rog,&quot;
I said, &quot;can you sign me a chit for a thousand credits without its going
on the record—for services rendered to the service?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>That's when I realized
he was half insane with relief and very temporary gratitude, because he said,
&quot;Sure, Max, sure. Ten thousand credits if you want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I <i>want,&quot;
</i>I<i> </i>said, grabbing him for a change. &quot;I want. I want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He filled out an
official Service chit for ten thousand credits; good as cash anywhere in half
the Galaxy. He was actually grinning as he gave it to me and you can bet I was
grinning as I took it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>How <i>he </i>intended
accounting for it was his affair; the point was that <i>I</i> wouldn't have to
account for it to Hilda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I stood in the booth,
one last time, signaling Flora. I didn't dare let matters go till I reached her
place. The additional half hour might just give her time to get someone else,
if she hadn't already.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Make her answer. Make
her answer. Make her—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She answered, but she
was in formal clothes. She was going out and I had obviously caught her by two
minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I am going
out,&quot; she announced. <i>&quot;Some </i>men can be decent. And I do not
wish to see you in the henceforward. I do not wish ever to find my eyes upon
you. You will do me a great favor, Mister Whoeveryouare, if you unhand my
signal combination and never pollute it with—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I wasn't saying
anything. I was just standing there holding my breath and also holding the chit
up where she could see it. Just standing there. Just holding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Sure enough, at the word
&quot;pollute&quot; she came in for a closer look. She wasn't much on
education, that girl, but she could read &quot;ten thousand credits&quot;
faster than any college graduate in the Solar System.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;Max!

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All for you,
baby,&quot; I said, &quot;I told you I had a little business to do. I wanted to
surprise you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, Max, that's
sweet of you. I didn't really mind. I was joking. Now you come right here to
me.&quot; She took off her coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What about your

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I <i>said </i>I

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;With every

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I broke contact,
stepped out of the booth, and now, finally, I was set—set—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I heard my name called.
&quot;Max! Max!&quot; Someone was running toward me. &quot;Rog Crinton said I
would find you here. Mamma's all right after all, so I got special passage on
the <i>Space Eater </i>and what's this about ten thousand credits?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I didn't turn. I said,
&quot;Hello, Hilda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And then I turned and
did the hardest thing I ever succeeded in doing in all my good-for-nothing,
space-hopping life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>I managed to smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For fifteen years now, the Hurrians had
maintained their base on the other side of the Moon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was unprecedented;
unheard of. No Hurrian had dreamed it possible to be delayed so long. The
decontamination squads had been ready; ready and waiting for fifteen years;
ready to swoop down through the radioactive clouds and save what might be saved
for the remnant of survivors.—In return, of course, for fair payment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But fifteen times the
planet had revolved about its Sun. During each revolution, the satellite had
rotated not quite thirteen times about the primary. And in all that time the
nuclear war had not come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Nuclear bombs were
exploded by the large-primate intelligences at various points on the planet's
surface. The planet's stratosphere had grown amazingly warm with radioactive
refuse. But still no war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en hoped ardently
that he would be replaced. He was the fourth Captain-in-charge of this
colonizing expedition (if it could still be called so after fifteen years of
suspended animation) and he was quite content that there should be a fifth. Now
that the home world was sending an Arch-administrator to make a personal survey
of the situation, his replacement might come soon. Good!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stood on the
surface of the Moon, encased in his space-suit, and thought of home, of Hurria.
His long, thin arms moved restlessly with the thought, as though aching
(through millions of years of instinct) for the ancestral trees. He stood only
three feet high. What could be seen of him through the glass-fronted head plate
was a black and wrinkled face with the fleshy, mobile nose dead-centered. The
little tuft of fine beard was a pure white in contrast. In the rear of the
suit, just below center, was the bulge within which the short and stubby Hurrian
tail might rest comfortably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en took his
appearance for granted, of course, but was well aware of the difference between
the Hurrians and all the other intelligences in the Galaxy. The Hurrians alone
were so small; they alone were tailed; they alone were vegetarians—they alone
had escaped the inevitable nuclear war that had ruined every other known
intelligent species.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stood on the walled
plain that extended for so many miles that the raised and circular rim (which
on Hurria would have been called a crater, if it were smaller) was invisible
beyond the horizon. Against the southern edge of the rim, where there was
always some protection against the direct rays of the Sun, a city had grown. It
had begun as a temporary camp, of course, but with the years, women had been
brought in, and children had been born in it. Now there were schools and
elaborate hydroponics establishments, large water reservoirs, all that went
with a city on an airless world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was ridiculous! All
because one planet had nuclear weapons and would not fight a nuclear war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The
Arch-administrator, who would be arriving soon, would undoubtedly ask, almost
at once, the same question that Devi-en had asked himself a wearisome number of
times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Why </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>had there not been a
nuclear war?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en watched the
hulking Mauvs preparing the ground now for the landing, smoothing out the unevennesses
and laying down the ceramic bed designed to absorb the hyperatomic
field-thrusts with minimum discomfort to the passengers within the ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Even in their
space-suits, the Mauvs seemed to exude power, but it was the power of muscle
only. Beyond them was the little figure of a Hurrian giving orders, and the
docile Mauvs obeyed. Naturally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Mauvian race, of
all the large-primate intelligences, paid their fees in the most unusual coin,
a quota of themselves, rather than of material goods. It was a surprisingly
useful tribute, better than steel, aluminum, or fine drugs in many ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en's receiver
stuttered to life. &quot;The ship is sighted, sir,&quot; came the report.
&quot;It will be landing within the hour.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Very good,&quot;
said Devi-en. &quot;Have my car made ready to take me to the ship as soon as
landing is initiated.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He did not feel that
it was very good at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administator
came, flanked by a personal retinue of five Mauvs. They entered the city with
him, one on each side, three following. They helped him off with his
space-suit, then removed their own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Their thinly haired
bodies, their large, coarse-featured faces, their broad noses and flat
cheekbones were repulsive but not frightening. Though twice the height of the
Hurrians and more than twice the breadth, there was a blankness about their
eyes, something completely submissive about the way they stood, with their
thick-sinewed necks slightly bent, their bulging arms hanging listlessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
dismissed them and they trooped out. He did not really need their protection,
of course, but his position required a retinue of five and that was that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>No business was
discussed during the meal or during the almost endless ritual of welcome. At a
time that might have been more appropriate for sleeping, the Arch-administrator
passed small fingers through his tuft of beard and said, &quot;How much longer
must we wait for this planet, Captain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was visibly
advancing in age. The hair on his upper arms was grizzled and the tufts at the
elbows were almost as white as his beard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I cannot say,
your Height,&quot; said Devi-en humbly. &quot;They have not followed the
path.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That is obvious.
The point is, <i>why </i>have they not followed the path? It is clear to the
Council that your reports promise more than they deliver. You talk of theories
but you give no details. Now we are tired of all this back on Hurria. If you
know of anything you have not told us, now is the time to talk of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The matter, your
Height, is hard to prove. We have had no experience of spying on a people over
such an extended period. Until recently, we weren't watching for the right
things. Each year we kept expecting the nuclear war the year after and it is
only in my time as Captain that we have taken to studying the people more
intensively. It is at least one benefit of the long waiting time that we have
learned some of their principal languages.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Indeed? Without
even landing on their planet?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en explained.
&quot;A number of radio messages were recorded by those of our ships that
penetrated the planetary atmosphere on observation missions, particularly in
the early years. I set our linguistics computers to work on them, and for the
last year I have been attempting to make sense out of it all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
stared. His bearing was such that any outright exclamation of surprise would
have been superfluous. &quot;And have you learned anything of interest?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I may have, your
Height, but what I have worked out is so strange and the underpinning of actual
evidence is so uncertain that I dared not speak of it officially in my
reports.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
understood. He said, stiffly, &quot;Would you object to explaining your views
unofficially— to me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I would be glad
to,&quot; said Devi-en at once. &quot;The inhabitants of this planet are, of
course, large-primate in nature. And they are competitive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The other blew out his
breath in a kind of relief and passed his tongue quickly over his nose. &quot;
I had the queer notion,&quot; he muttered, &quot;that they might <i>not </i>be
competitive and that that might—But go on, go on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;They <i>are </i>competitive,&quot;
Devi-en assured him. &quot;Much more so than one would expect on the
average.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then why doesn't
everything else follow?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Up to a point it
does, your Height. After the usual long incubation period, they began to
mechanize; and after that, the usual large-primate killings became truly
destructive warfare. At the conclusion of the most recent large-scale war,
nuclear weapons were developed and the war ended at once.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
nodded. &quot;And then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en said,
&quot;What should have happened was that a nuclear war ought to have begun
shortly afterward and in the course of the war, nuclear weapons would have
developed quickly in destructiveness, have been used nevertheless in typical
large-primate fashion, and have quickly reduced the population to starving
remnants in a ruined world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course, but
that didn't happen. Why not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en said,
&quot;There is one point. I believe these people, once mechanization started,
developed at an unusually high rate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And if so?&quot;
said the other. &quot;Does that matter? They reached nuclear weapons the more
quickly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;True. But after
the most recent general war, they continued to develop nuclear weapons at an
unusual rate. That's the trouble. The deadly potential had increased before the
nuclear war had a chance to start and now it has reached a point where even
large-primate intelligences dare not risk a war.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
opened his small black eyes wide. &quot;But that is impossible. I don't care
how technically talented these creatures are. Military science advances rapidly
only during a war.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Perhaps that is
not true in the case of these particular creatures. But even if it were, it
seems they <i>are </i>having a war; not a real war, but a war.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not a real war,
but a war,&quot; repeated the Arch-administrator blankly. &quot;What does that
mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm not
sure.&quot; Devi-en wiggled his nose in exasperation. &quot;This is where my
attempts to draw logic out of the scattered material we have picked up is least
satisfactory. This planet has something called a Cold War. Whatever it is, it
drives them furiously onward in research and yet it does not involve complete
nuclear destruction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
said, &quot;Impossible!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en said,
&quot;There is the planet. Here we are. We have been waiting fifteen
years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The
Arch-administrator's long arms came up and crossed over his head and down again
to the opposite shoulders. &quot;Then there <i>is </i>only one thing to do. The
Council has considered the possibilty that the planet may have achieved a
stalemate, a kind of uneasy peace that balances just short of a nuclear war.
Something of the sort you describe, though no one suggested the actual reasons
you advance. But it's something we can't allow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, your
Height?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No,&quot; he
seemed almost in pain. &quot;The longer the stalemate continues, the greater
the possibility that large-primate individuals may discover the methods of
interstellar travel. They will leak out into the Galaxy, in full competitive
strength. You see?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
hunched his head deeper into his arms, as though not wishing to hear what he
himself must say. His voice was a little muffled. &quot;If they are balanced
precariously, we must push them a little, Captain. We must push them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en's stomach
churned and he suddenly tasted his dinner once more in the back of his throat.
&quot;Push them, your Height?&quot; He didn't want to understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But the
Arch-administrator put it bluntly, &quot;We must help them start their nuclear
war.&quot; He looked as miserably sick as Devi-en felt. He whispered, &quot;We
must!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en could scarcely
speak. He said, in a whisper, &quot;But how could such a thing be done, your
Height?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't know
how.—And do not look at <i>me </i>so. It is not my decision. It is the decision
of the Council. Surely you understand what would happen to the Galaxy if a
large-primate intelligence were to enter space in full strength without having
been tamed by nuclear war.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en shuddered at
the thought. All that competitiveness loosed on the Galaxy. He persisted
though. &quot;But <i>how </i>does one start a nuclear war? How is it
done?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't know, I
tell you. But there must be some way; perhaps a—a message we might send or a—a
crucial rainstorm we might start by cloud-seeding. We could manage a great deal
with their weather conditions—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How would that
start a nuclear war?&quot; said Devi-en, unimpressed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Maybe it
wouldn't. I mention such a thing only as a possible example. But large-primates
would know. After all, they are the ones who <i>do </i>start nuclear wars in
actual fact. It is in their brain-pattern to know. That is the decision the
Council came to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en felt the soft
noise his tail made as it thumped slowly against the chair. He tried to stop it
and failed. &quot;What decision, your Height?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;To trap a
large-primate from the planet's surface. To kidnap one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A <i>wild </i>one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's the only
kind that exists at the moment on the planet. Of course, a wild one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And what do you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That doesn't
matter, Captain. As long as he says enough about anything, mentalic analysis
will give us the answer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en withdrew his
head as far as he could into the space between his shoulder blades. The skin
just under his armpits quivered with repulsion. A wild large-primate being! He
tried to picture one, untouched by the stunning aftermath of nuclear war,
unaltered by the civilizing influence of Human eugenic breeding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The Arch-administrator
made no attempt to hide the fact that he shared the repulsion, but he said,
&quot;You will have to lead the trapping expedition, Captain. It is for the
good of the Galaxy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en had seen the
planet a number of times before but each time a ship swung about the Moon and
placed the world in his line of sight a wave of unbearable homesickness swept
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was a beautiful
planet, so like Hurria itself in dimensions and characteristics but wilder and
grander. The sight of it, after the desolation of the Moon, was like a blow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>How many other planets
like it were on Hurrian master listings at this moment, he wondered. How many
other planets were there concerning which meticulous observers had reported
seasonal changes in appearance that could be interpreted only as being caused
by artificial cultivation of food plants? How many times in the future would a
day come when the radioactivity in the stratosphere of one of these planets
would begin to climb; when colonizing squadrons would have to be sent out at
once?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>—As they were to this
planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was almost
pathetic, the confidence with which the Hurrians had proceeded at first.
Devi-en could have laughed as he read through those initial reports, if he
weren't trapped in this project himself now. The Hurrian scoutships had moved
close to the planet to gather geographical information, to locate population
centers. They were sighted, of course, but what did it matter? Any time, now,
they thought, the final explosion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Any time—But useless
years passed and the scoutships wondered if they ought not to be cautious. They
moved back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en's ship was
cautious now. The crew was on edge because of the unpleasantness of the
mission; not all Devi-en's assurances that there was no harm intended to the
large-primate could quite calm them. Even so, they could not hurry matters. It
had to be over a fairly deserted and uncultivated tract of uneven ground that
they hovered. They stayed at a height of ten miles for days, while the crew
became edgier and only the ever-stolid Mauvs maintained calm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then the scope showed
them a creature, alone on the uneven ground, a long staff in one hand, a pack
across the upper portion of his back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They lowered silently,
supersonically. Devi-en himself, skin crawling, was at the controls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The creature was heard
to say two definite things before he was taken, and they were the first
comments recorded for use in mentalic computing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The first, when the
large-primate caught sight of the ship almost upon him, was picked up by the
direction telemike. It was, &quot;My God! A flying saucer!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en understood the
second phrase. That was a term for the Hurrian ships that had grown common
among the large-primates those first careless years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The second remark was
made when the wild creature was brought into the ship, struggling with amazing
strength, but helpless in the iron grip of the unperturbed Mauvs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en, panting, with
his fleshy nose quivering slightly, advanced to receive him, and the creature
(whose unpleasantly hairless face had become oily with some sort of fluid
secretion) yelled, &quot;Holy Toledo, a <i>monkey!&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Again, Devi-en
understood the second part. It was the word for little-primate in one of the
chief languages of the planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The wild creature was
almost impossible to handle. He required infinite patience before he could be
spoken to reasonably. At first, there was nothing but a series of crises. The
creature realized almost at once that he was being taken off Earth, and what
Devi-en thought might prove an exciting experience for him, proved nothing of
the sort. He talked instead of his offspring and of a large-primate female.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(They have wives and
children, thought Devi-en, compassionately, and, in their way, love them, for
all they are large-primate.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then he had to be made
to understand that the Mauvs who kept him under guard and who restrained him
when his violence made that necessary would not hurt him, that he was not to be
damaged in any way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(Devi-en was sickened
at the thought that one intelligent being might be damaged by another. It was
very difficult to discuss the subject, even if only to admit the possibility
long enough to deny it. The creature from the planet treated the very
hesitation with great suspicion. It was the way the large-primates were.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>On the fifth day, when
out of sheer exhaustion, perhaps, the creature remained quiet over a fairly
extended period, they talked in Devi-en's private quarters, and suddenly he
grew angry again when the Human first explained, matter-of-factly, that they
were waiting for a nuclear war,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Waiting!&quot;
cried the creature. &quot;What makes you so sure there will be one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en wasn't sure,
of course, but he said, &quot;There is always a nuclear war. It is our purpose
to help you afterward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Help us <i>afterward.&quot;
</i>His words grew incoherent. He waved his arms violently, and the Mauvs who
flanked him had to restrain him gently once again and lead him away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en sighed. The
creature's remarks were building in quantity and perhaps mentalics could do
something with them. His own unaided mind could make nothing of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And meanwhile the
creature was not thriving. His body was almost completely hairless, a fact that
long-distance observation had not revealed owing to the artificial skins worn
by them. This was either for warmth or because of an instinctive repulsion even
on the part of these particular large-primates themselves for hairless skin.
(It might be an interesting subject to take up. Mentalics computation could
make as much out of one set of remarks as another.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Strangely enough, the
creature's face had begun to sprout hair; more, in fact, than the Hurrian face
had, and of a darker color.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But still, the central
fact was that he was not thriving. He had grown thinner because he was eating
poorly, and if he was kept too long, his health might suffer. Devi-en had no
wish to feel responsible for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>On the next day, the
large-primate seemed quite calm. He talked almost eagerly, bringing the subject
around to nuclear warfare almost at once. (It had a terrible attraction for the
large-primate mind, Devi-en thought.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The creature said,
&quot;You said nuclear wars always happen? Does that mean there are other
people than yours and mine—and theirs?&quot; He indicated the near-by Mauvs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;There are
thousands of intelligent species, living on thousands of worlds. Many
thousands,&quot; said Devi-en.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And they all
have nuclear wars?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All who have
reached a certain stage of technology. All but us. We were different. We lacked
competitiveness. We had the co-operative instinct.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean you
know that nuclear wars will happen and you do nothing about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We <i>do&quot; </i>said
Devi-en, pained. &quot;Of course, we do. We try to help. In the early history
of my people, when we first developed space-travel, we did not understand
large-primates. They repelled our attempts at friendship and we stopped trying.
Then we found worlds in radioactive ruins. Finally, we found one world actually
in the process of a nuclear war. We were horrified, but could do nothing.
Slowly, we learned. We are ready, now, at every world we discover to be at the
nuclear stage. We are ready with decontamination equipment and eugenic
analyzers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What are eugenic
analyzers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en had
manufactured the phrase by analogy with what he knew of the wild one's
language. Now he said carefully, &quot;We direct matings and sterilizations to
remove, as far as possible, the competitive element in the remnant of the
survivors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For a moment, he
thought the creature would grow violent again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Instead, the other
said in a monotone, &quot;You make them docile, you mean, like these
things?&quot; Once again he indicated the Mauvs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No. No. These
are different. We simply make it possible for the remnants to be content with a
peaceful, nonexpanding, nonaggressive society under our guidance. Without this,
they destroyed themselves, you see, and without it, they would destroy
themselves again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What do you get
out of it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en stared at the
creature dubiously. Was it really necessary to explain the basic pleasure of
life? He said, &quot;Don't you enjoy helping someone?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Come on. Besides
that. What's in it for you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course, there
are contributions to Hurria.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ha.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Payment for
saving a species is only fair,&quot; protested Devi-en, &quot;and there are
expenses to be covered. The contribution is not much and is adjusted to the
nature of the world. It may be an annual supply of wood from a forested world;
manganese salts from another. The world of these Mauvs is poor in physical
resources and they themselves offered to supply us with a number of individuals
to use as personal assistants. They are extremely powerful even for
large-primates and we treat them painlessly with anticerebral drugs—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;To make zombies
out of them!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en guessed at the
meaning of the noun and said indignantly, &quot;Not at all. Merely to make them
content with their role as personal servant and forgetful of their homes. We
would not want them to be unhappy. They are intelligent beings!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And what would
you do with Earth if we had a war?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We have had
fifteen years to decide that,&quot; said Devi-en. &quot;Your world is very rich
in iron and has developed a fine steel technology. Steel, I think, would be
your contribution.&quot; He sighed, &quot;But the contribution would not make
up for our expense in this case, I think. We have overwaited now by ten years
at least.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The large-primate
said, &quot;How many races do you tax in this way?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I do not know
the exact number. Certainly more than a thousand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then you're  the
little  landlords  of the  Galaxy, are you? A thousand worlds destroy
themselves in order to contribute to your welfare. You're something else, too,
you know.&quot; The wild one's voice was rising, growing shrill. &quot;You're
vultures.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Vultures?&quot;
said Devi-en, trying to place the word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Carrion-eaters.
Birds that wait for some poor creature to die of thirst in the desert and then
come down to eat the body.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en felt himself
turn faint and sick at the picture conjured up for him. He said weakly,
&quot;No, no, we <i>help </i>the species.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You wait for the
war to happen like vultures. If you want to help, <i>prevent </i>the war. Don't
save the remnants. Save them all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en's tail
twitched with sudden excitement. &quot;How do we prevent a war? Will you tell
me that?&quot; (What was prevention of war but the reverse of bringing about a
war? Learn one process and surely the other would be obvious.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But the wild one
faltered. He said finally, &quot;Get down there. Explain the situation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en felt keen
disappointment. That didn't help. Besides— He said, &quot;Land among you? Quite
impossible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>His skin quivered in
half a dozen places at the thought of mingling with the wild ones in their
untamed billions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Perhaps the sick look
on Devi-en's face was so pronounced and unmistakable that the wild one could
recognize it for what it was even across the barrier of species. He tried to
fling himself at the Hurrian and had to be caught virtually in mid-air by one
of the Mauvs, who held him immobile with an effortless constriction of biceps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The wild one screamed.
&quot;No. Just sit here and wait! Vulture! Vulture! <i>Vulture!&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was days before
Devi-en could bring himself to see the wild one again. He was almost brought to
disrespect of the Arch-administrator when the latter insisted that he lacked
sufficient data for a complete analysis of the mental make-up of these wild
ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en said boldly,
&quot;Surely, there is enough to give some solution to our question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The
Arch-administrator's nose quivered and his pink tongue passed over it
meditatively. &quot;A solution of a kind, perhaps. I can't trust this solution.
We are facing a very unusual species. We know that already. We can't afford to make
mistakes.—One thing, at least. We have happened upon a highly intelligent one.
Unless—unless he is at his race's norm.&quot; The Arch-administrator seemed
upset at that thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en said,
&quot;The creature brought up the horrible picture of that—that bird—that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Vulture,&quot;
said the Arch-administrator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It put our
entire mission into such a distorted light. I have not been able to eat
properly since, or sleep. In fact, I am afraid I will have to ask to be
relieved—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not before we
have completed what we have set out to do,&quot; said the Arch-administrator
firmly. &quot;Do you think I enjoy the picture of—of carrion-eat—You <i>must </i>collect
more data.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en nodded
finally. He understood, of course. The Arch-administrator was no more anxious
to cause a nuclear war than any Hurrian would be. He was putting off the moment
of decision as long as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Devi-en settled
himself for one more interview with the wild one. It turned out to be a
completely unbearable one, and the last.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The wild one had a
bruise across his cheek as though he had been resisting the Mauvs again. In
fact, it was certain he had. He had done so numerous times before, and the
Mauvs, despite their most earnest attempts to do no harm, could not help but
bruise him on occasion. One would expect the wild one to see how intensely they
tried not to hurt him and to quiet his behavior as a result. Instead, it was as
though the conviction of safety spurred him on to additional resistance.</span></p>

miserable animal, or man, maybe, is taking too long to die? They can't wait.
They come swirling down and peck out his eyes. They wait till he's helpless and

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So after a little over
fifteen years, the Hurrians were dismantling their base on the other side of

understood. The wild one had been replaced on his planet with minimal harm. The
events of the past weeks had been blanked out of his mind. He had been placed
near a small, inhabited locality not far from the spot where he had been first
found. His fellows would assume he had been lost. They would blame his loss of
weight, his bruises, his amnesia upon the hardships he had undergone.</span></p>

brought him up to the Moon in the first place. They might have reconciled
themselves to the thought of starting a war. They might somehow have thought of
dropping a bomb; and worked out some indirect, long-distance system for doing
so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It had been the wild
one's word-picture of the vulture that had stopped it all. It had ruined
Devi-en and the Arch-administrator. When all data was sent back to Hurria, the

had come quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;
The dark-complexioned face with its sharp, black eyes seemed restless.
&quot;Both cases are quite low probability.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know
that,&quot; said Gulliman. &quot;I observed that neither probability is higher
than 15 per cent. Just the same, Multivac has a reputation to maintain. It has
virtually wiped out crime, and the public judges that by its record on
first-degree murder which is, of course, the most spectacular crime.&quot;</span></p>

realize, I hope,&quot; Gulliman said, &quot;that I don't want a single
consummated case of it during my term. If any other crime slips through, I may
allow excuses. If a first-degree murder slips through, I'll have your hide.
Understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, sir. The

dropping.&quot;</span></p>

had to be firm with these permanent civil-service personnel and make sure they
didn't imagine they were running everything, including the Chairman.

considerably younger, and had a proprietary air that could be infuriating.</span></p>

time. The previous Chairman had ended with a record of eight, three more <i>(more,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He barely skimmed the
rest of the report. He estimated that there were at least two thousand cases of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Multivac had added
wife-beating to its list of predictable crimes only some five years earlier and
the average man was not yet accustomed to the thought that if he planned to
wallop his wife, it would be known in advance. As the conviction percolated
through society, woman would first suffer fewer bruises and then, eventually,
none.</span></p>

head had departed. Then he looked across at his assistant, Rafe Leemy and said,
&quot;What do we do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't ask me. <i>He's
</i>worried about just a lousy murder or two.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's an awful
chance trying to handle this thing on our own. Still if we tell him, he'll have
a first-class fit. These elective politicians have their skins to think of, so
he's bound to get in our way and make things worse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Leemy nodded his head
and put a thick lower lip between his teeth. &quot;Trouble is, though, what if
we miss out? It would just about be the end of the world, you know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If we miss out,
who cares what happens to us? We'll just be part of the general
catastrophe.&quot; Then he said in a more lively manner, &quot;But hell, the
probability is only 12.3 per cent. On anything else, except maybe murder, we'd
let the probabilities rise a bit before taking any action at all. There could
still be spontaneous correction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I wouldn't count
on it,&quot; said Leemy dryly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't intend
to. I was just pointing the fact out. Still, at this probability, I suggest we
confine ourselves to simple observation for the moment. No one could plan a
crime like this alone; there must be accomplices.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Multivac didn't
name any.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know. Still—&quot;
His voice trailed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So they stared at the
details of the one crime not included on the list handed out to Gulliman; the
one crime much worse than first-degree murder; the one crime never before
attempted in the history of Multivac; and wondered what to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ben Manners considered
himself the happiest sixteen-year-old in Baltimore. This was, perhaps,
doubtful. But he was certainly one of the happiest, and one of the most
excited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>At least, he was one
of the handful admitted to the galleries of the stadium during the swearing in
of the eighteen-year-olds. His older brother was going to be sworn in so his
parents had applied for spectator's tickets and they had allowed Ben to do so, too.
But when Multivac chose among all the applicants, it was Ben who got the
ticket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Two years later, Ben
would be sworn in himself, but watching big brother Michael now was the next
best thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>His parents had
dressed him (or supervised the dressing, at any rate) with all care, as
representative of the family and sent him off with numerous messages for
Michael, who had left days earlier for preliminary physical and neurological
examinations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The stadium was on the
outskirts of town and Ben, just bursting with self-importance, was shown to his
seat. Below him, now, were rows upon rows of hundreds upon hundreds of
eighteen-year-olds (boys to the right, girls to , the left), all from the
second district of Baltimore. At various times in the year, similar meetings
were going on all over the world, but this was Baltimore, this was the
important one. Down there (somewhere) was Mike, Ben's own brother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ben scanned the tops
of heads, thinking somehow he might recognize his brother. He didn't, of
course, but then a man came out on the raised platform in front of all the
crowd and Ben stopped looking to listen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The man said,
&quot;Good afternoon, swearers and guests. I am Randolph T. Hoch, in charge of
the Baltimore ceremonies this year. The swearers have met me several times now
during the progress of the physical and neurological portions of this
examination. Most of the task is done, but the most important matter is left.
The swearer himself, his personality, must go into Multivac's records.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Each year, this
requires some explanation to the young people reaching adulthood. Until
now&quot; (he turned to the young people before him and his eyes went no more
to the gallery) &quot;you have not been adult; you have not been individuals in
the eyes of Multivac, except where you were especially singled out as such by
your parents or your government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Until now, when
the time for the yearly up-dating of information came, it was your parents who
filled in the necessary data on you. Now the time has come for you to take over
that duty yourself. It is a great honor, a great responsibility. Your parents
have told us what schooling you've had, what diseases, what habits; a great
many things. But now you must tell us a great deal more; your innermost
thoughts; your most secret deeds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;This is hard to
do the first time, embarrassing even, but it <i>must </i>be done. Once it is
done, Multivac will have a complete analysis of all of you in its files. It
will understand your actions and reactions. It will even be able to guess with
fair accuracy at your future actions and reactions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In this way,
Multivac will protect you. If you are in danger of accident, it will know. If
someone plans harm to you, it will know. If <i>you </i>plan harm, it will know
and you will be stopped in time so that it will not be necessary to punish you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;With its
knowledge of all of you, Multivac will be able to help Earth adjust its economy
and its laws for the good of all. If you have a personal problem, you may come
to Multivac with it and with its knowledge of all of you, Multivac will be able
to help you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now you will
have many forms to fill out. Think carefully and answer all questions as
accurately as you can. Do not hold back through shame or caution. No one will
ever know your answers except Multivac unless it becomes necessary to learn the
answers in order to protect you. And then only authorized officials of the
government will know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It may occur to
you to stretch the truth a bit here or there. Don't do this. We will find out
if you do. All your answers put together form a pattern. If some answers are
false, they will not fit the pattern and Multivac will discover them. If all
your answers are false, there will be a distorted pattern of a type that
Multivac will recognize. So you must tell the truth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Eventually, it was all
over, however; the form-filling; the ceremonies and speeches that followed. In
the evening, Ben, standing tiptoe, finally spotted Michael, who was still
carrying the robes he had worn in the &quot;parade of the adults.&quot; They
greeted one another with jubilation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They shared a light
supper and took the expressway home, alive and alight with the greatness of the
day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were not
prepared, then, for the sudden transition of the home-coming. It was a numbing
shock to both of them to be stopped by a cold-faced young man in uniform
outside their own front door; to have their papers inspected before they could
enter their own house; to find their own parents sitting forlornly in the
living room, the mark of tragedy on their faces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Joseph Manners,
looking much older than he had that morning, looked out of his puzzled,
deep-sunken eyes at his sons (one with the robes of new adulthood still over
his arm) and said, &quot;I seem to be under house arrest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Bernard Gulliman could
not and did not read the entire report. He read only the summary and that was
most gratifying, indeed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A whole generation, it
seemed, had grown up accustomed to the fact that Multivac could predict the
commission of major crimes. They learned that Corrections agents would be on
the scene before the crime could be committed. They found out that consummation
of the crime led to inevitable punishment. Gradually, they were convinced that
there was no way anyone could outsmart Multivac.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The result was,
naturally, that even the intention of crime fell off. And as such intentions
fell off and as Multivac's capacity was enlarged, minor crimes could be added
to the list it would predict each morning, and these crimes, too, were now
shrinking in incidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So Gulliman had ordered
an analysis made (by Multivac naturally) of Multivac's capacity to turn its
attention to the problem of predicting probabilities of disease incidence.
Doctors might soon be alerted to individual patients who might grow diabetic in
the course of the next year, or suffer an attack of tuberculosis or grow a
cancer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>An ounce of prevention—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And the report was a
favorable one!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>After that, the roster
of the day's possible crimes arrived and there was not a first-degree murder on
the list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Gulliman put in an
intercom call to Ali Othman in high good humor. &quot;Othman, how do the
numbers of crimes in the daily lists of the past week average compared with
those in my first week as Chairman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It had gone down, it
turned out, by 8 per cent and Gulliman was happy indeed. No fault of his own,
of course, but the electorate would not know that. He blessed his luck that he
had come in at the right time, at the very climax of Multivac, when disease,
too, could be placed under its all-embracing and protecting knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Gulliman would prosper
by this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Othman shrugged his
shoulders. &quot;Well, he's happy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;When do we break
the bubble?&quot; said Leemy. &quot;Putting Manners under observation just
raised the probabilities and house arrest gave it another boost.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't I know
it?&quot; said Othman peevishly. &quot;What I don't know is why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Accomplices,
maybe, like you said. With Manners in trouble, the rest have to strike at once
or be lost.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Just the other
way around. With our hand on one, the rest would scatter for safety and
disappear. Besides, why aren't the accomplices named by Multivac?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, then, do
we tell Gulliman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, not yet. The
probability is still only 17.3 per cent. Let's get a bit more drastic
first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Elizabeth Manners said
to her younger son, &quot;You go to your room, Ben.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But what's it
all about, Mom?&quot; asked Ben, voice breaking at this strange ending to what
had been a glorious day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Please!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He left reluctantly,
passing through the door to the stairway, walking up it noisily and down again
quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And Mike Manners, the
older son, the new-minted adult and the hope of the family, said in a voice and
tone that mirrored his brother's, &quot;What's it all about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Joe Manners said,
&quot;As heaven is my witness, Son, I don't know. I haven't done
anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, sure you
haven't done anything.&quot; Mike looked at his small-boned, mild-mannered
father in wonder. &quot;They must be here because you're <i>thinking </i>of
doing something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mrs. Manners broke in
angrily, &quot;How can he be thinking of doing something worth all—all
this.&quot; She cast her arm about, in a gesture -toward the enclosing shell of
government men about the house. &quot;When I was a little girl, I remember the
father of a friend of mine was working in a bank, and they once called him up
and said to leave the money alone and he did. It was fifty thousand dollars. He
hadn't really taken it. He was just thinking about taking it. They didn't keep
those things as quiet in those days as they do now; the story got out. That's
how I know about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But I
mean,&quot; she went on, rubbing her plump hands slowly together, &quot;that
was fifty thousand dollars; fifty— thousand—dollars. Yet all they did was call
him; one phone call. What could your father be planning that would make it
worth having a dozen men come down and close off the house?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Joe Manners said, eyes
filled with pain, &quot;I am planning no crime, not even the smallest. I swear
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mike, filled with the
conscious wisdom of a new adult, said, &quot;Maybe it's something subconscious,
Pop. Some resentment against your supervisor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So that I would

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>His mother interrupted
again, &quot;No, they won't. We've asked. I said they were ruining our standing
in the community just being here. The least: they could do is tell us what it's
all about so we could fight it, so we could explain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And they

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mike stood with his
legs spread apart and his hands deep in his pockets. He said, troubled,
&quot;Gee, Mom, Multivac doesn't make mistakes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>His father pounded his
fist helplessly on the arm of the sofa. &quot;I tell you I'm not planning any

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The door opened
without a knock and a man in uniform walked in with sharp, self-possessed
stride. His face had a glazed, official appearance. He said, &quot;Are you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Joe Manners rose to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Joseph Manners,
I place you under arrest by order of the government,&quot; and curtly he showed
his identification as a Corrections officer. &quot;I must ask you to come with
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;For what reason?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I am not at

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But I can't be
arrested just for planning a crime even if I were doing that. To be arrested I
must actually have <i>done </i>something. You can't arrest me otherwise. It's
against the law.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The officer was
impervious to the logic. &quot;You will have to come with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mrs. Manners shrieked
and fell on the couch, weeping hysterically. Joseph Manners could not bring
himself to violate the code drilled into him all his life by actually resisting
an officer, but he hung back at least, forcing the Corrections officer to use
muscular power to drag him forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And Manners called out
as he went, &quot;But tell me what it is. Just tell me. If I <i>knew</i>— Is it
murder? Am I supposed to be planning murder?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The door closed behind
him and Mike Manners, white<b>-</b>faced and suddenly feeling not the least bit
adult, stared first at the door, then at his weeping mother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ben Manners, behind
the door and suddenly feeling quite adult, pressed his lips tightly together
and thought he knew exactly what to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>If Multivac took away,
Multivac could also give. Ben had been at the ceremonies that very day. He had
heard this man, Randolph Hoch, speak of Multivac and all that Multivac could
do. It could direct the government and it could also unbend and help out some
plain person who came to it for help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Anyone could ask help
of Multivac and anyone meant Ben. Neither his mother nor Mike were in any
condition to stop him now, and he had some money left of the amount they had
given him for his great outing that day. If afterward they found him gone and
worried about it, that couldn't be helped. Right now, his first loyalty was to
his father.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He ran out the back
way and the officer at the door cast a glance at his papers and let him go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Harold Quimby handled
the complaints department of the Baltimore substation of Multivac. He
considered himself to be a member of that branch of the civil service that was
most important of all. In some ways, he may have been right, and those who
heard him discuss the matter would have had to be made of iron not to feel
impressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For one thing, Quimby
would say, Multivac was essentially an invader of privacy. In the past fifty
years, mankind had had to acknowledge that its thoughts and impulses were no
longer secret, that it owned no inner recess where anything could be hidden.
And mankind had to have something in return.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Of course, it got
prosperity, peace, and safety, but that was abstract. Each man and woman needed
something personal as his or her own reward for surrendering privacy, and each
one got it. Within reach of every human being was a Multivac station with
circuits into which he could freely enter his own problems and questions
without control or hindrance, and from which, in a matter of minutes, he could
receive answers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>At any given moment,
five million individual circuits among the quadrillion or more within Multivac
might be involved in this question-and-answer program. The answers might not
always be certain, but they were the best available, and every questioner <i>knew
</i>the answer to be the best available and had faith in it. That was what
counted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And now an anxious
sixteen-year-old had moved slowly up the waiting line of men and women (each in
that line illuminated by a different mixture of hope with fear or anxiety or
even anguish—always with hope predominating as the person stepped nearer and
nearer to Multivac).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Without looking up,
Quimby took the filled-out form being handed him and said, &quot;Booth
5-B.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ben said, &quot;How do
I ask the question, sir?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Quimby looked up then,
with a bit of surprise. Preadults did not generally make use of the service. He
said kindly, &quot;Have you ever done this before, son?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Quimby pointed to the
model on his desk. &quot;You use this. You see how it works? Just like a
typewriter. Don't you try to write or print anything by hand. Just use the
machine. Now you take booth 5-B, and if you need help, just press the red
button and someone will come. Down that aisle, son, on the right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He watched the
youngster go down the aisle and out of view and smiled. No one was ever turned
away from Multivac. Of course, there was always a certain percentage of trivia:
people who asked personal questions about their neighbors or obscene questions
about prominent personalities; college youths trying to outguess their
professors or thinking it clever to stump Multivac by asking it Russell's
class-of-all-classes paradox and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Multivac could take
care of all that. It needed no help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Besides, each question
and answer was filed and formed but another item in the fact assembly for each
individual. Even the most trivial question and the most impertinent, insofar as
it reflected the personality of the questioner, helped humanity by helping
Multivac know about humanity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Quimby turned his attention
to the next person in line, a middle-aged woman, gaunt and angular, with the
look of trouble in her eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ali Othman strode the
length of his office, his heels thumping desperately on the carpet. &quot;The
probability still goes up. It's 22.4 per cent now. Damnation! We have Joseph
Manners under actual arrest and it still goes up.&quot; He was perspiring
freely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Leemy turned away from
the telephone. &quot;No confession yet. He's under Psychic Probing and there is
no sign of crime. He may be telling the truth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Othman said, &quot;Is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Another phone sprang
to life. Othman closed connections quickly, glad of the interruption. A
Corrections officer's face came to life in the screen. The officer said,
&quot;Sir, are there any new directions as to Manners' family? Are they to be
allowed to come and go as they have been?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What do you
mean, as they have been?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The original
instructions were for the house arrest of Joseph Manners. Nothing was said of
the rest of the family, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, extend it

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sir, that is the
point. The mother and older son are demanding information about the younger
son. The younger son is gone and they claim he is in custody and wish to go to
headquarters to inquire about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Othman frowned and
said in<i> </i>almost a whisper, &quot;Younger son? How young?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sixteen,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sixteen and he's
gone. Don't you know where?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He was allowed
to leave, sir. There were no orders to hold him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Hold the line.
Don't move.&quot; Othman put the line into suspension, then clutched at his
coal-black hair with both lands and shrieked, &quot;Fool! Fool! Fool!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Leemy was startled.
&quot;What the hell?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The man has a
sixteen-year-old son,&quot; choked out Othman. &quot;A sixteen-year-old is not
an adult and he is not filed independently in Multivac, but only as part of his
father's file.&quot; He glared at Leemy. &quot;Doesn't everyone know that until
eighteen a youngster does not file his own reports with Multivac but that his father
does it for him? Don't I know it? Don't you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Multivac meant
his minor son, and the youngster is gone, now. With officers three deep around
the house, he calmly walks out and goes on you know what errand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He whirled to the
telephone circuit to which the Corrections officer still clung, the minute
break having given Othman just time enough to collect himself and to assume a
cool and self-possessed mien. (It would never have done to throw a fit before
the eyes of the officer, however much good it did in purging his spleen.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said,
&quot;Officer, locate the younger son who has disappeared. Take every man you
have, if necessary. Take every man available in the district, if necessary. I
shall give the appropriate orders. You must find that boy at all costs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Connection was broken.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Five minutes later,
Leemy said, &quot;It's down to 19.6 per cent. It's <i>down.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Othman drew a long
breath. &quot;We're on the right track at last.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Ben Manners sat in
Booth 5-B and punched out slowly, &quot;My name is Benjamin Manners, number
MB-71833412. My father, Joseph Manners, has been arrested but we don't know
what crime he is planning. Is there any way we can help him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He sat and waited. He
might be only sixteen but he was old enough to know that somewhere those words
were being whirled into the most complex structure ever conceived by man; that
a trillion facts would blend and co-ordinate into a whole, and that from that
whole, Multivac would abstract the best help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The machine clicked
and a card emerged. It had an answer on it, a long answer. It began, &quot;Take
the expressway to Washington, D.C. at once. Get off at the Connecticut Avenue
stop. You will find a special exit, labeled 'Multivac' with a guard. Inform the
guard you are special courier for Dr. Trumbull and he will let you enter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It went on in this

father is free now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you mean
Multivac ordered the boy to pull a lever under circumstances that would burn
out enough circuits to require a month's repair work? You mean Multivac would
suggest its own destruction for the comfort of one man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's worse than
that, sir. Multivac not only gave those instructions but selected the Manners
family in the first place because Ben Manners looked exactly like one of Dr.
Trumbull's pages so that he could get into Multivac without being
stopped.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What do you mean
the family was selected?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, the boy
would have never gone to ask the question if his father had not been arrested.
His father would never have been arrested if Multivac had not blamed him for
planning the destruction of Multivac. Multivac's own action started the chain
of events that almost led to Multivac's destruction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But there's no
sense to that,&quot; Gulliman said in a pleading voice. He felt small and
helpless and he was virtually on his knees, begging this Othman, this man who
had spent nearly a lifetime with Multivac, to reassure him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Othman did not do so.
He said, &quot;This is Multivac's first attempt along this line as far as I
know. In some ways, it planned well. It chose the right family. It carefully
did not distinguish between father and son to send us off the track. It was
still an amateur at the game, though. It could not overcome its own
instructions that led it to report the probability of its own destruction as
increasing with every step we took down the wrong road. It could not avoid
recording the answer it gave the youngster. With further practice, it will
probably learn deceit. It will learn to hide certain facts, fail to record
certain others. From now on, every instruction it gives may have the seeds in
it of its own destruction. We will never know. And however careful we are, eventually
Multivac will succeed. I think, Mr. Gulliman, you will be the last Chairman of
this organization.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Gulliman pounded his

Can't it be fixed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't think
so,&quot; said Othman, in soft despair. &quot;I've never thought about this
before. I've never had the occasion to until this happened, but now that I
think of it, it seems to me we have reached the end of the road because
Multivac is too good. Multivac has grown so complicated, its reactions are no
longer those of a machine, but those of a living thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

and more we have been loading humanity's troubles on Multivac, on this living
thing. We've asked it to care for us, all together and each individually. We've
asked it to take all our secrets into itself; we've asked it to absorb our evil
and guard us against it. Each of us brings his troubles to it, adding his bit
to the burden. Now we are planning to load the burden of human disease on
Multivac, too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Othman paused a moment,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No. But it will

behind an old desk that must have been secondhand when bought. No desk could

brightly alive.</span></p>

out of a team and into—into <i>me.&quot; </i>Zebatinsky felt carried away,
almost lightheaded, just putting this into words to someone other than his
wife. He said, &quot;Twenty-five years ago, with my kind of training and my
kind of ability, I would have gotten to work on the first nuclear power plants.
Today I'd be running one of them or I'd be head of a pure research group at a
university. But with my start these days where will I be twenty-five years from
now? Nowhere. Still on the team. Still carrying my 2 per cent of the ball. I'm
drowning in an anonymous crowd of nuclear physicists, and what I want is room
on dry land, if you see what I mean.&quot;</span></p>

matter of fact. I am a mathematician and I work mathematically. I don't tell
you this in order to raise my fee. That is standard. Fifty dollars. But since
you are a scientist, you can appreciate the nature of my work better than my
other clients. It is even a pleasure to be able to explain to you.&quot;</span></p>

work on the assumption that I am a numerologist, and I am not. I call myself
that so that the police won't bother me and&quot; (the little man chuckled
dryly) &quot;so that the psychiatrists won't either. I am a mathematician; an
honest one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Does that sound
worse than numerology to you? Why? Given enough data and a computer capable of
sufficient number of operations in unit time, the future is predictable, at
least in terms of probabilities. When you compute the motions of a missile in
order to aim an anti-missile, isn't it the future you're predicting? The
missile and antimissile would not collide if the future were predicted
incorrectly. I do the same thing. Since I work with a greater number of
variables, my results are less accurate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean you'll
predict <i>my </i>future?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Very
approximately. Once I have done that, I will modify the data by changing your
name and no other fact about you. I throw that modified datum into the operation-program.
Then I try other modified names. I study each modified future and find one that
contains a greater degree of recognition for you than the future that now lies
ahead of you. Or no, let me put it another way. I will find you a future in
which the probability of adequate recognition is higher than the probability of
that in your present future.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why change my

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That is the only
change I ever make, for several reasons. Number one, it is a simple change.
After all, if I make a great change or many changes, so many new variables
enter that I can no longer interpret the result. My machine is still crude.
Number two, it is a reasonable change. I can't change your height, can I, or
the color of your eyes, or even your temperament. Number three, it is a
significant change. Names mean a lot to people. Finally, number four, it is a
common change that is done every day by various people.&quot;</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The numerologist
sighed. &quot;I thought a person like yourself would feel more comfortable with
the truth. I <i>want </i>to help you and there is much yet for you to do. If
you believed me a numerologist, you would not follow through. I thought if I
told you the truth you would let me help you.&quot;</span></p>

recognition and I want to be left alone. I do my work. No one bothers me. That
makes me a billionaire. I need a little real money and this I get from people
such as yourself. Helping people is nice and perhaps a psychiatrist would say
it gives me a feeling of power and feeds my ego. Now—do you want me to help

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He had tried wiping
the thing out of his mind several times. He could never stick at filling out
the necessary data for long. It was embarrassing to work at it. He felt
incredibly silly filling out the names of his friends, the cost of his house,
whether his wife had had any miscarriages, if so, when. He abandoned it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But he .couldn't stick
at stopping altogether either. He returned to it each evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was the thought of
the computer that did it, perhaps; the thought of the infernal gall of the
little man pretending he had a computer. The temptation to call the bluff, see
what would happen, proved irresistible after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He finally sent off
the completed data by ordinary mail, putting on nine cents worth of stamps
without weighing the letter. If it comes back, he thought, I'll call it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It didn't come back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He looked into the
shop now and it was empty. Zebatinsky had no choice but to enter. A bell
tinkled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The old numerologist
emerged from a curtained door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes?—Ah, Dr.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You remember

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What's the
verdict?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The numerologist moved
one gnarled hand over the other. &quot;Before that, sir, there's a
little—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A little matter
of the fee?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I have already
done the work, sir. I have earned the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Zebatinsky raised no
objection. He was prepared to pay. If he had come this far, it would be silly
to turn back just because of the money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He counted out five
ten-dollar bills and shoved them across the counter. &quot;Well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The numerologist
counted the bills again slowly, then pushed them into a cash drawer in his
desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;Your
case was very interesting. I would advise you to change your name to
Sebatinsky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Seba—How do you
spell that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;S-e-b-a-t-i-n-s-k-y.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Zebatinsky stared
indignantly. &quot;You mean change the initial? Change the <i>Z </i>to an <i>S?
</i>That's all?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's enough. As
long as the change is adequate, a small change is safer than a big one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But how could
the change affect anything?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How could any
name?&quot; asked the numerologist softly. &quot;I can't say. It may, somehow,
and that's all I can say. Remember, I don't guarantee results. Of course, if
you do not wish to make the change, leave things as they are. But in that case
I cannot refund the fee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Zebatinsky said,
&quot;What do I do? Just tell everyone to spell my name with an 5?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If you want my
advice, consult a lawyer. Change your name legally. He can advise you on little
things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How long will it
all take? I mean for things to improve for me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How can I tell?
Maybe never. Maybe tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But you saw the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not as in a
crystal ball. No, no, Dr. Zebatinsky. All I get out of my computer is a set of
coded figures. I can recite probabilities to you, but I saw no pictures.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Zebatinsky turned and
walked rapidly out of the place. Fifty dollars to change a letter! Fifty
dollars for Sebatinsky! Lord, what a name! Worse than Zebatinsky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It took another month
before he could make up his mind to see a lawyer, and then he finally went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He told himself he
could always change the name back. Give it a chance, he told himself. Hell,
there was no law against it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Henry Brand looked through the folder page by
page, with the practiced eye of one who had been in Security for fourteen
years. He didn't have to read every word. Anything peculiar would have leaped
off the paper and punched him in the eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;The man
looks clean to me.&quot; Henry Brand looked clean, too; with a soft, rounded
paunch and a pink and freshly scrubbed complexion. It was as though continuous
contact with all sorts of human failings, from possible ignorance to possible
treason, had compelled him into frequent washings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Lieutenant Albert
Quincy, who had brought him the folder, was young and filled with the
responsibility of being Security officer at the Hanford Station. &quot;But why
Sebatinsky?&quot; he demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Because it doesn't
make sense. Zebatinsky is a foreign name and I'd change it myself if I had it,
but I'd change it to something Anglo-Saxon. If Zebatinsky had done that, it
would make sense and I wouldn't give it a second thought. But why change a Z to
an <i>S? </i>I think we must find out what his reasons were.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Has anyone asked
him directly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Certainly. In
ordinary conversation, of course. I was careful to arrange that. He won't say
anything more than that he's tired of being last in the alphabet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That could be,
couldn't it, Lieutenant?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It could, but
why not change his name to Sands or Smith, if he wants an <i>S? </i>Or if he's
that tired of Z, why not go the whole way and change it to an <i>A? </i>Why not
a name like—uh—Aarons?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not Anglo-Saxon
enough,&quot; muttered Brand. Then, &quot;But there's nothing to pin against
the man. No matter how queer a name change may be, that alone can't be used
against anyone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Lieutenant   Quincy  
looked   markedly   unhappy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand said, &quot;Tell
me, Lieutenant, there must be something specific that bothers you. Something in
your mind; some theory; some gimmick. What is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The lieutenant
frowned. His light eyebrows drew together and his lips tightened. &quot;Well,
damn it, sir, the man's<sup> </sup>a Russian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand said, &quot;He's
not that. He's a third-generation American.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I mean his
name's Russian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand's face lost some
of its deceptive softness. &quot;No, Lieutenant, wrong again. Polish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The lieutenant pushed
his hands out impatiently, palms up. &quot;Same thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand, whose mother's
maiden name had been Wiszewski, snapped, &quot;Don't tell that to a Pole,
Lieutenant.&quot; —Then, more thoughtfully, &quot;Or to a Russian either, I
suppose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What I'm trying
to say, sir,&quot; said the lieutenant, reddening, &quot;is that the Poles and
Russians are both on the other side of the Curtain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We all know that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And Zebatinsky
or Sebatinsky, whatever you want to call him, may have relatives there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He's third
generation. He might have second cousins there, I suppose. So what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Nothing in
itself. Lots of people may have distant relatives there. But Zebatinsky changed
his name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Go on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Maybe he's
trying to distract attention. Maybe a second cousin over there is getting too
famous and our Zebatinsky is afraid that the relationship may spoil his own
chances of advancement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Changing his
name won't do any good. He'd still be a second cousin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sure, but he
wouldn't feel as though he were shoving the relationship in our face.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Have <i>you </i>ever
heard of any Zebatinsky on the other side?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then he can't be
too famous. How would our Zebatinsky know about him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He might keep in
touch with his own relatives. That would be suspicious under the circumstances,
he being a nuclear physicist.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Methodically,  Brand
went through the folder again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;This is awfully
thin, Lieutenant. It's thin enough to be completely invisible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Can you offer
any other explanation, sir, of why he ought to change his name in just this
way?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, I can't. I
admit that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then I think,
sir, we ought to investigate. We ought to look for any men named Zebatinsky on
the other side and see if we can draw a connection.&quot; The lieutenant's
voice rose a trifle as a new thought occurred to him. &quot;He might be
changing his name to withdraw attention from <i>them; </i>I<i> </i>mean to
protect them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He's doing just
the opposite, I think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He doesn't
realize that, maybe, but protecting them could be his motive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand sighed.
&quot;All right, well tackle the Zebatinsky angle.—But if nothing turns up,
Lieutenant, we drop the matter. Leave the folder with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>When the information
finally reached Brand, he had all but forgotten the lieutenant and his
theories. His first thought on receiving data that included a list of seventeen
biographies of seventeen Russian and Polish citizens, all named Zebatinsky,
was: What the devil is this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then he remembered,
swore mildly, and began reading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It started on the
American side. Marshall Zebatinsky (fingerprints) had been born in Buffalo, New
York (date, hospital statistics). His father had been born in Buffalo as well,
his mother in Oswego, New York. His paternal grandparents had both been born in
Bialystok, Poland (date of entry into the United States, dates of citizenship,
photographs).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The seventeen Russian
and Polish citizens named Zebatinsky were all descendants of people who, some
half century earlier, had lived in or near Bialystok. Presumably, they could be
relatives, but this was not explicitly stated in any particular case. (Vital
statistics in East Europe during the aftermath of World War I were kept poorly,
if at all.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand passed through
the individual life histories of the current Zebatinsky men and women (amazing
how thoroughly intelligence did its work; probably the Russians' was as
thorough). He stopped at one and his smooth forehead sprouted lines as his eyebrows
shot upward. He put that one to one side and went on. Eventually, he stacked
everything but that one and returned it to its envelope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Staring at that one,
he tapped a neatly kept fingernail on the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>With a certain
reluctance, he went to call on Dr. Paul Kristow of the Atomic Energy
Commission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Kristow listened
to the matter with a<i> </i>stony expression. He lifted a little finger
occasionally to dab at his bulbous nose and remove a nonexistent speck. His
hair was iron gray, thinning and cut short. He might as well have been bald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;No, I
never heard of any Russian Zebatinsky. But then, I never heard of the American
one either.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,&quot;
Brand scratched at his hairline over one temple and said slowly, &quot;I don't
think there's anything to this, but I don't like to drop it too soon. I have a
young lieutenant on my tail and you know what they can be like. I don't want to
do anything that will drive him to a Congressional committee. Besides, the fact
is that one of the Russian Zebatinsky fellows, Mikhail Andreyevich Zebatinsky, <i>is
</i>a nuclear physicist. Are you sure you never heard of him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Mikhail
Andreyevich Zebatinsky? No—No, I never did. Not that that proves
anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I could say it
was coincidence, but you know that would be piling it a trifle high. One
Zebatinsky here and one Zebatinsky there, both nuclear physicists, and the one
here suddenly changes his name to Sebatinsky, and goes around anxious about it,
too. He won't allow misspelling. He says, emphatically, 'Spell my name with an <i>S.'
</i>It all just fits well enough to make my spy-conscious lieutenant begin to
look a little too good.—And another peculiar thing is that the Russian
Zebatinsky dropped out of sight just about a year ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Kristow said
stolidly, &quot;Executed!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He might have
been. Ordinarily, I would even assume so, though the Russians are not more
foolish than we are and don't kill any nuclear physicist they can avoid
killing. The thing is there's another reason why a nuclear physicist, of all
people, might suddenly disappear. I don't have to tell you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Crash research;
top secret. I take it that's what you mean. Do you believe that's it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Put it together
with everything else, add in the lieutenant's intuition, and I just begin to
wonder.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Give me that
biography.&quot; Dr. Kristow reached for the sheet of paper and read it over
twice. He shook his head. Then he said, &quot;I'll check this in <i>Nuclear
Abstracts.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Nuclear Abstracts </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>lined one wall of Dr.
Kristow's study in neat little boxes, each filled with its squares of
microfilm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The A.E.C. man used
his projector on the indices while Brand watched with what patience he could
muster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Kristow muttered,
&quot;A Mikhail Zebatinsky authored or co-authored half a dozen papers in the
Soviet journals in the last half dozen years. We'll get out the abstracts and
maybe we can make something out of it. I doubt it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A selector nipped out
the appropriate squares. Dr. Kristow lined them up, ran them through the
projector, and by degrees an expression of odd intentness crossed his face. He
said, &quot;That's odd.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand said,
&quot;What's odd?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Kristow sat back.
&quot;I'd rather not say just yet. Can you get me a list of other nuclear
physicists who have dropped out of sight in the Soviet Union hi the last
year?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean you see
something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not really. Not if<i>
</i>I were just looking at any one of these papers. It's just that looking at
all of them and knowing that this man may be on a crash research program and,
on top of that, having you putting suspicions in my head—&quot; He shrugged.
&quot;It's nothing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand said earnestly,
&quot;I wish you'd say what's on your mind. We may as well be foolish about
this together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If you feel that
way—It's just possible this man may have been inching toward gamma-ray
reflection.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And the
significance?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;If a reflecting
shield against gamma rays could be devised, individual shelters could be built
to protect against fallout. It's fallout that's the real danger, you know. A
hydrogen bomb might destroy a city but the fallout could slow-kill the
population over a strip thousands of miles long and hundreds wide.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand said quickly,
&quot;Are we doing any work on this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And if they get
it and we don't, they can destroy the United States <i>in toto </i>at the cost
of, say, ten cities, after they have their shelter program completed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's far in the
future.—And, what are we getting in a hurrah about? All this is built on one
man changing one letter in his name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right, I'm
insane,&quot; said Brand. &quot;But I don't leave the matter at this point. Not
at <i>this </i>point. I'll get you your list of disappearing nuclear physicists
if I have to go to Moscow to get it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He got the list. They
went through all the research papers authored by any of them. They called a
full meeting of the Commission, then of the nuclear brains of the nation. Dr.
Kristow walked out of an all night session, finally, part of which the
President himself had attended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand met him. Both
looked haggard and in need of sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand said,
&quot;Well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Kristow nodded.
&quot;Most agree. Some are doubtful even yet, but most agree.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How about you?
Are you sure?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm far from
sure, but let me put it this way. It's easier to believe that the Soviets are
working on a gamma-ray shield than to believe that all the data we've uncovered
has no interconnection.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Has it been
decided that we're to go on shield research, too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes.&quot;
Kristow's hand went back over his short, bristly hair, making a dry, whispery
sound. &quot;We're going to give it everything we've got. Knowing the papers
written by the men who disappeared, we can get right on their heels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>We may even beat them
to it. —Of course, they'll find out we're working on it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Let them,&quot;
said Brand. &quot;Let them. It will keep them from attacking. I don't see any
percentage in selling ten of our cities just to get ten of theirs—if we're both
protected and they're too dumb to know that&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But not too
soon. We don't want them finding out <i>too </i>soon. What about the American
Zebatinsky-Sebatinsky?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand looked solemn
and shook his head. &quot;There's nothing to connect him with any of this even
yet. Hell, we've <i>looked. </i>I agree with you, of course. He's in a sensitive
spot where he is now and we can't afford to keep him there even if he's in the
clear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We can't kick
him out just like that, either, or the Russians will start wondering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do you have any
suggestions?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were walking down
the long corridor toward the distant elevator in the emptiness of four in the
morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Kristow said,
&quot;I've looked into his work. He's a good man, better than most, and not
happy in his job, either. He hasn't the temperament for teamwork.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But he is the
type for an academic job. If we can arrange to have a large university offer
him a chair in physics, I think he would take it gladly. There would be enough
nonsensitive areas to keep him occupied; we would be able to keep him in close
view; <i>and </i>it would be a natural development. The Russians might not
start scratching their heads. What do you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Brand nodded.
&quot;It's an idea. Even sounds good. I'll put it up to the chief.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They stepped into the
elevator and Brand allowed himself to wonder about it all. What an ending to
what had started with one letter of a name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Marshall Sebatinsky
could hardly talk. He said to his wife, &quot;I swear I don't see how this
happened. I wouldn't have thought they knew me from a meson detector.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>—Good Lord, Sophie,
Associate Professor of Physics at Princeton. Think of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Sophie said, &quot;Do
you suppose it was your talk at the A.P.S. meetings?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't see how.
It was a thoroughly uninspired paper once everyone in the division was done
hacking at it.&quot; He snapped his fingers. &quot;It must have been Princeton
that was investigating me. That's it. You know all those forms I've been
filling out in the last six months; those interviews they wouldn't explain.
Honestly, I was beginning to think I was under suspicion as a subversive.—It
was Princeton investigating me. They're thorough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Maybe it was
your name,&quot; said Sophie. &quot;I mean the change.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Watch me now. My
professional life will be my own finally. I'll make my mark. Once I have a
chance to do my work without—&quot; He stopped and turned to look at his wife.
&quot;My name! You mean the <i>S.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You didn't get
the offer till after you changed your name, did you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not till long
after. No, that part's just coincidence. I've told you before Sophie, it was
just a case of throwing out fifty dollars to please you. Lord, what a fool I've
felt all these months insisting on that stupid <i>S.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Sophie was instantly
on the defensive. &quot;I didn't make you do it, Marshall. I suggested it but I
didn't nag you about it. Don't say I did. Besides, it did turn out well. I'm
sure it was the name that did this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Sebatinsky smiled
indulgently. &quot;Now that's superstition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't care
what you call it, but you're not changing your name back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, no, I
suppose not. I've had so much trouble getting them to spell my name with an <i>S,
</i>that the thought of making everyone move back is more than I want to face.
Maybe I ought to change my name to Jones, eh?&quot; He laughed almost
hysterically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Sophie didn't.
&quot;You leave it alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, all right,
I'm just joking. —Tell you what. I'll step down to that old fellow's place one
of these days and tell him everything worked out and slip him another tenner.
Will that satisfy you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was exuberant
enough to do so the next week. He assumed no disguise this time. He wore his

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was even humming as

You won't change the results any by taking a long time.—Wowf, it's a relief to

you, Mestack, is that you don't want to pay off. You're stalling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'll pay. But
just wait till the Watchman finds out we've been working on an unassigned
problem and made an unallowed-for change. Of course, if we—&quot; He paused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Haround said,
&quot;All right, we'll change it back. He'll never know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a crafty
glow to Mestack's brightening energy pattern. &quot;You'll need another Class F
stimulus if you expect him not to notice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Haround hesitated.
&quot;I can do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I doubt
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I could.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Would you be
willing to bet on that, too?&quot; Jubilation was creeping into Mestack's
radiations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sure,&quot; said
the goaded Haround. &quot;I'll put those corporeals right back where they were
and the Watchman will never know the difference.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mestack followed
through his advantage. &quot;Suspend the first bet, then. Triple the stakes on
the second.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The mounting eagerness
of the gamble caught at Haround, too. &quot;All right, I'm game. Triple the
stakes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Done, then!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Done.&quot;</span></p>

<h3 style='margin-top:6.0pt'>THE LAST QUESTION</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The last question was asked for the first
time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into
the light. The question came about as a result of a five-dollar bet over
highballs, and it happened this way:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Alexander Adell and
Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any
human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face—miles
and miles of face—of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of
the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the
point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Multivac was
self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could
adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. —So Adell and
Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well
as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and
translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like
them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For decades, Multivac
had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach
the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not
support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth
exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only
so much of both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But slowly Multivac
learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14,
2061, what had been theory, became fact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The energy of the sun
was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth
turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and nipped the switch that
connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the
Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of
sunpower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Seven days had not
sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape
from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of
looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the
mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with
contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys
appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They had brought a
bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the
company of each other and the bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's amazing
when you think of it,&quot; said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness
in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of
ice slur clumsily about. &quot;All the energy we can possibly ever use for
free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big
drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the
energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Lupov cocked his head sideways.
He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, and he wanted to be
contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware.
&quot;Not forever,&quot; he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, hell, just
about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's not
forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right, then.
Billions and billions of years. Twenty billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Lupov put his fingers
through his thinning  hair  as though to reassure himself that some was still
left and sipped gently at his own drink. 'Twenty billion years isn't
forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, it will
last our time, won't it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So would the
coal and uranium.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right, but
now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can
go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You
can't do <i>that </i>on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don't believe
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I don't have to
ask Multivac. I know that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then stop
running down what Multivac's done for us,&quot; said Adell, blazing up.
&quot;It did all right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Who says it
didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all I'm saying.
We're safe for twenty billion years, but then what?&quot; Lupov pointed a
slightly shaky finger at the other. &quot;And don't say we'll switch to another
sun.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was silence for
a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov's eyes
slowly closed. They rested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then Lupov's eyes
snapped open. &quot;You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when ours is
done, aren't you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm not
thinking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sure you are.
You're weak on logic, that's the trouble with you. You're like the guy in the
story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got
under one. He wasn't worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet
through, he would just get under another one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I get it,&quot;
said Adell. &quot;Don't shout. When the sun is done, the other stars will be
gone, too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Darn right they
will,&quot; muttered Lupov. &quot;It all had a beginning in the original cosmic
explosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run
down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won't last a hundred
million years. The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will
last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion
years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that's
all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know all about
entropy,&quot; said Adell, standing on his dignity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;The hell you
do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know as much
as you do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Then you know
everything's got to run down someday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right. Who
says they won't?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You did, you
poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever. You said
'forever.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was Adell’s turn to
be contrary. &quot;Maybe we can build things up again someday,&quot; he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Never.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why not?
Someday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Never.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ask
Multivac.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>ask Multivac. I dare
you. Five dollars says it can't be done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Adell was just drunk
enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and
operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this:
Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore
the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Or maybe it could be
put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be
massively decreased?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Multivac fell dead and
silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking
relays ended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then, just as the
frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a
sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multi-vac.
Five words were printed: <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>insufficient
data for meaningful answer.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No bet,&quot;
whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly. By next morning, the two, plagued with
throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten the incident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerrodd, Jerrodine,
and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as
the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once,
the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright
marble-disk, centered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's
X-23,&quot; said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped   tightly  
behind   his   back   and   the   knuckles whitened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The little
Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first
time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of
inside-outness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about
their mother, screaming, &quot;We've reached X-23—we've reached X-23—we've—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Quiet, children,&quot;
said Jerrodine sharply. &quot;Are you sure, Jerrodd?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What is there to
be but sure?&quot; asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal
just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the
wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerrodd scarcely knew
a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that
one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task
of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from
the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the
hyperspacial jumps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerrodd and his family
had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Someone had once told
Jerrodd that the &quot;ac&quot; at the end of &quot;Microvac&quot; stood for
&quot;analog computer&quot; in ancient English, but he was on the edge of
forgetting even that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerrodine's eyes were
moist as she watched the visiplate. &quot;I can't help it. I feel funny about
leaving Earth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why, for Pete's
sake?&quot; demanded Jerrodd. &quot;We had nothing there. We'll have everything
on X-23. You won't be alone. You won't be a pioneer. There are over a million
people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great-grandchildren will be
looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded.&quot; Then, after a
reflective pause, &quot;I tell you, it's a lucky thing the computers worked out
interstellar travel the way the race is growing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know, I
know,&quot; said Jerrodine miserably.-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerrodette I said
promptly, &quot;Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I think so,
too,&quot; said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It <i>was </i>a nice
feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his
generation and no other. In his father's youth, the only computers had been tremendous
machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a
planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They had been growing in size steadily
for a thousand years' and then, all at once, came refinement. In place of
transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC
could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerrodd felt uplifted,
as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times
more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac that had first tamed
the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth's Planetary AC (the largest) that
had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the
stars possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;So many stars,
so many planets,&quot; sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. &quot;I
suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not
forever,&quot; said Jerrodd, with a smile. &quot;It will all stop someday, but
not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know.
Entropy must increase.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

face outlined in profile against the window. The forehead retreated flatly and
his hair lay down in tufts upon it. The back of his skull bulged and seemed to
make the head overheavy so that it sagged and bent forward, forcing the whole
body into a stoop. Already, bony ridges were beginning to bulge the skin above
his eyes. His wide mouth thrust forward more prominently than did his wide and
flattened nose and he had no chin to speak of, only a jawbone that curved
smoothly down and back. He was small for his years and his stumpy legs were
bowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Hoskins was there,
but he only looked at her distantly and murmured, &quot;Miss Fellowes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He did not even
suggest that she take a seat, but she drew one calmly up to the railing and sat
down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were on a
balcony, looking down into a large pit, filled with instruments that looked
like a cross between the control panel of a spaceship and the working face of a
computer. On one side were partitions that seemed to make up an unceilinged
apartment, a giant dollhouse into the rooms of which she could look from above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She could see an
electronic cooker and a freeze-space unit in one room and a washroom
arrangement off another. And surely the object she made out in another room
could only be part of a bed, a small bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins was speaking
to another man and, with Miss Fellowes, they made up the total occupancy of the
balcony. Hoskins did not offer to introduce the other man, and Miss Fellowes
eyed him surreptitiously. He was thin and quite fine-looking in a middle-aged
way. He had a small mustache and keen eyes that seemed to busy themselves with
everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was saying, &quot;I
won't pretend for one moment that I understand all this, Dr. Hoskins; I mean,
except as a layman, a reasonably intelligent layman, may be expected to understand
it. Still, if there's one part I understand less than another, it's this matter
of selectivity. You can only reach out so far; that seems sensible; things get
dimmer the further you go; it takes more energy.—But then, you can only reach
out so near. That's the puzzling part.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I can make it
seem less paradoxical, Deveney, if you will allow me to use an analogy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(Miss Fellowes placed
the new man the moment she heard his name, and despite herself was impressed.
This was obviously Candide Deveney, the science writer of the Telenews, who was
notoriously at the scene of every major scientific break-through. She even
recognized his face as one she saw on the news-plate when the landing on Mars
had been announced.—So Dr. Hoskins must have something important here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;By all means use
an analogy,&quot; said Deveney ruefully, &quot;if you think it will help.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, then, you
can't read a book with ordinary-sized print if it is held six feet from your
eyes, but you can read it if you hold it one foot from your eyes. So far, the
closer the better. If you bring the book to within one inch of your eyes,
however, you've lost it again. There is such a thing as being too close, you
see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Hmm,&quot; said
Deveney.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Or take another
example. Your right shoulder is about thirty inches from the tip of your right
forefinger and you can place your right forefinger on your right shoulder. Your
right elbow is only half the distance from the tip of your right forefinger; it
should by all ordinary logic be easier to reach, and yet you cannot place your
right finger on your right elbow. Again, there is such a thing as being too
close.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Deveney said,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, of course.
Only too glad. I've been waiting long enough for someone like you to have a
story. I'll give you anything else you want. It is time, finally, that we want
the world looking over our shoulder. They'll see something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Forty thousand

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was tension in
the air. The men at the controls scarcely moved. One man at a microphone spoke
into it in a soft monotone, in short phrases that made no sense to Miss
Fellowes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Deveney, leaning over
the balcony railing with an intent stare, said, &quot;Will we see anything, Dr.
Hoskins?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What? No.
Nothing till the job is done. We detect indirectly, something on the principle
of radar, except that we use mesons rather than radiation. Mesons reach
backward under the proper conditions. Some are reflected and we must analyze
the reflections.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That sounds
difficult.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins smiled again,
briefly as always. &quot;It is the end product of fifty years of research;
forty years of it before I entered the field.—Yes, it's difficult.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The man at the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;We've had the fix on one particular moment in time for weeks; breaking
it, remaking it after calculating our own movements in time; making certain
that we could handle time-flow with sufficient precision. This must work
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But his forehead

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The-man at the microphone

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a space of
silence sufficient for one breath and then the sound of a terrified little
boy's scream from the dollhouse rooms. Terror! Piercing terror!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes' head
twisted in the direction of the cry. A child was involved. She had forgotten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And Hoskins' fist
pounded on the railing and he said in a tight voice, trembling with triumph, <i>&quot;Did
</i>it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes was
urged down the short, spiral flight of steps by the hard press of Hoskins' palm
between her shoulder blades. He did not speak to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The men who had been
at the controls were standing about now, smiling, smoking, watching the three
as they entered on the main floor. A very soft buzz sounded from the direction
of the dollhouse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said to
Deveney, &quot;It's perfectly safe to enter Stasis. I've done it a thousand
times. There's a queer sensation which is momentary and means nothing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stepped through an
open door in mute demonstration, and Deveney, smiling stiffly and drawing an
obviously deep breath, followed him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;Miss Fellowes! Please!&quot; He crooked his forefinger impatiently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes nodded
and stepped stiffly through. It was as though a ripple went through her, an
internal tickle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But once inside all
seemed normal. There was the smell of the fresh wood of the dollhouse and—of—of
soil somehow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was silence now,
no voice at last, but there was the dry shuffling of feet, a scrabbling as of a
hand over wood—then a low moan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Where is
it?&quot; asked Miss Fellowes in distress. Didn't these fool men <i>care?</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy was in the
bedroom; at least the room with the bed in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was standing naked,
with its small, dirt-smeared chest heaving raggedly. A bushel of dirt and
coarse grass spread over the floor at his bare brown feet. The smell of soil
came from it and a touch of something fetid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins followed her
horrified glance and said with annoyance, &quot;You can't pluck a boy cleanly
out of time, Miss Fellowes. We had to take some of the surroundings with it for
safety. Or would you have preferred to have it arrive here minus a leg or with
only half a head?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Please!&quot; </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>said Miss Fellowes, in
an agony of revulsion. &quot;Are we just to stand here? The poor child is
frightened. And it's <i>filthy.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She was quite correct.
It was smeared with encrusted dirt and grease and had a scratch on its thigh
that looked red and sore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>As Hoskins approached
him, the boy, who seemed to be something over three years in age, hunched low
and backed away rapidly. He lifted his upper lip and snarled in a hissing
fashion like a cat. With a rapid gesture, Hoskins seized both the child's arms
and lifted him, writhing and screaming, from the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;Hold him, now. He needs a warm bath first. He needs to be cleaned. Have
you the equipment? If so, have it brought here, and I'll need to have help in
handling him just at first. Then, too, for heaven's sake, have all this trash
and filth removed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She was giving the
orders now and she felt perfectly good about that. And because now she was an
efficient nurse, rather than a confused spectator, she looked at the child with
a clinical eye—and hesitated for one shocked moment. She saw past the dirt and
shrieking, past the thrashing of limbs and useless twisting. She saw the boy
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was the ugliest
little boy she had ever seen. It was horribly ugly from misshapen head to bandy
legs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She got the boy
cleaned with three men helping her and with others milling about in their
efforts to clean the room. She worked in silence and with a sense of outrage,
annoyed by the continued strugglings and outcries of the boy and by the
undignified drenchings of soapy water to which she was subjected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Hoskins had hinted
that the child would not be pretty, but that was far from stating that it would
be repulsively deformed. And there was a stench about the boy that soap and
water was only alleviating little by little.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She had the strong
desire to thrust the boy, soaped as he was, into Hoskins' arms and walk out;
but there was the pride of profession. She had accepted an assignment, after
all.—And there would be the look in his eyes. A cold look that would read: Only
pretty children, Miss Fellowes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was standing apart
from them, watching coolly from a distance with a half-smile on his face when
he caught her eyes, as though amused at her outrage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She decided she would
wait a while before quitting. To do so now would only demean her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then, when the boy was
a bearable pink and smelled of scented soap, she felt better anyway. His cries
changed to whimpers of exhaustion as he watched carefully, eyes moving in quick
frightened suspicion from one to another of those in the room. His cleanness
accentuated his thin nakedness as he shivered with cold after his bath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said
sharply, &quot;Bring me a nightgown for the child!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A nightgown appeared
at once. It was as though everything were ready and yet nothing were ready
unless she gave orders; as though they were deliberately leaving this in her
charge without help, to test her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The newsman, Deveney,
approached and said, &quot;I'll hold him, Miss. You won't get it on
yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
said Miss Fellowes. And it was a battle indeed, but the nightgown went on, and
when the boy made as though to rip it off, she slapped his hand sharply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy reddened, but
did not cry. He stared at her and the splayed fingers of one hand moved slowly
across the flannel of the nightgown, feeling the strangeness of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes thought
desperately: Well, what next?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Everyone seemed in
suspended animation, waiting for her—even the ugly little boy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said
sharply, &quot;Have you provided food? Milk?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They had. A mobile
unit was wheeled in, with its refrigeration compartment containing three quarts
of milk, with a warming unit and a supply of fortifications in the form of
vitamin drops, copper-cobalt-iron syrup and others she had no time to be
concerned with. There was a variety of canned self-warming junior foods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She used milk, simply
milk, to begin with. The radar unit heated the milk to a set temperature in a
matter of ten seconds and clicked off, and she put some in a saucer. She had a
certainty about the boy's savagery. He wouldn't know how to handle a cup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes nodded
and said to the boy, &quot;Drink. Drink.&quot; She made a gesture as though to
raise the milk to her mouth. The boy's eyes followed but he made no move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Suddenly, the nurse
resorted to direct measures. She seized the boy's upper arm in one hand and
dipped the other in the milk. She dashed the milk across his lips, so that it
dripped down cheeks and receding chin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For a moment, the
child uttered a high-pitched cry, then his tongue moved over his wetted lips.
Miss Fellowes stepped back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy approached the
saucer, bent toward it, then looked up and behind sharply as though expecting a
crouching enemy; bent again and licked at the milk eagerly, like a cat. He made
a slurping noise. He did not use his hands to lift the saucer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes allowed
a bit of the revulsion she felt show on her face. She couldn't help it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Deveney caught that,
perhaps. He said, &quot;Does the nurse know, Dr. Hoskins?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Know what?&quot;
demanded Miss Fellowes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Deveney hesitated, but
Hoskins (again that look of detached amusement on his face) said, &quot;Well,
tell her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Deveney addressed Miss
Fellowes. &quot;You may not suspect it, Miss, but you happen to be the first
civilized woman in history ever to be taking care of a Neanderthal
youngster.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She turned on Hoskins
with a kind of controlled ferocity. &quot;You might have told me, Doctor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why? What
difference does it make?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You said a
child.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Isn't that a
child? Have you ever had a puppy or a kitten, Miss Fellowes? Are those closer
to the human? If that were a baby chimpanzee, would you be repelled? You're a
nurse, Miss Fellowes. Your record places you in a maternity ward for three
years. Have you ever refused to take care of a deformed infant?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes felt her
case slipping away. She said, with much less decision, &quot;You might have
told me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you would
have refused the position? Well, do you refuse it now?&quot; He gazed at her
coolly, while Deveney watched from the other side of the room, and the
Neanderthal child, having finished the milk and licked the plate, looked up at
her with a wet face and wide, longing eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy pointed to the
milk and suddenly burst out in a short series of sounds repeated over and over;
sounds made up of gutturals and elaborate tongue-clickings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said, in
surprise, &quot;Why, he talks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course,&quot;
said Hoskins. &quot;Homo neanderthalensis is not a truly separate species, but
rather a subspecies of Homo sapiens. Why shouldn't he talk? He's probably
asking for more milk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Automatically, Miss
Fellowes reached for the bottle of milk, but Hoskins seized her wrist.
&quot;Now, Miss Fellowes, before we go any further, are you staying on the
job?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes shook
free in annoyance, &quot;Won't you feed him if I don't? I'll stay with him—for
a while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She poured the milk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said, &quot;We
are going to leave you with the boy, Miss Fellowes. This is the only door to
Stasis Number One and it is elaborately locked and guarded. I'll want you to
learn the details of the lock which will, of course, be keyed to your
fingerprints as they are already keyed to mine. The spaces overhead&quot; (he
looked upward to the open ceilings of the dollhouse) &quot;are also guarded and
we will be warned if anything untoward takes place in here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said
indignantly, &quot;You mean I'll be under view.&quot; She thought suddenly of
her own survey of the room interiors from the balcony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, no,&quot;
said Hoskins seriously, &quot;your privacy will be respected completely. The
view will consist of electronic symbolism only, which only a computer will deal
with. Now you will stay with him tonight, Miss Fellowes, and every night until
further notice. You will be relieved during the day according to some schedule
you will find convenient. We will allow you to arrange that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes looked
about the dollhouse with a puzzled expression. &quot;But why all this, Dr.
Hoskins? Is the boy dangerous?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's a matter of
energy, Miss Fellowes. He must never be allowed to leave these rooms. Never.
Not for an instant. Not for any reason. Not to save his life. Not even to save <i>your
</i>life, Miss Fellowes. Is that clear?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes raised
her chin. &quot;I understand the orders, Dr. Hoskins, and the nursing
profession is accustomed to placing its duties ahead of
self-preservation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Good. You can
always signal if you need anyone.&quot; And the two men left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes turned
to the boy. He was watching her and there was still milk in the saucer.
Laboriously, she tried to show him how to lift the saucer and place it to his
lips. He resisted, but let her touch him without crying out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Always, his frightened
eyes were on her, watching, watching for the one false move. She found herself
soothing him, trying to move her hand very slowly toward his hair, letting him
see it every inch of the way, see there was no harm in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And she succeeded in
stroking his hair for an instant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;I'm
going to have to show you how to use the bathroom. Do you think you can
learn?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She spoke quietly,
kindly, knowing he would not understand the words but hoping he would respond
to the calmness of the tone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy launched into
a clicking phrase again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;May I
take your hand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She held out hers and
the boy looked at it. She left it outstretched and waited. The boy's own hand
crept forward toward hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's
right,&quot; she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It approached within
an inch of hers and then the boy's courage failed him. He snatched it back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,&quot; said
Miss Fellowes calmly, &quot;we'll try again later. Would you like to sit down
here?&quot; She patted the mattress of the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The hours passed
slowly and progress was minute. She did not succeed either with bathroom or
with the bed. In fact, after the child had given unmistakable signs of
sleepiness he lay down on the bare ground and then, with a quick movement,
rolled beneath the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She bent to look at
him and his eyes gleamed out at her as he tongue-clicked at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right,&quot;
she said, &quot;if you feel safer there, you sleep there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She closed the door to
the bedroom and retired to the cot that had been placed for her use in the
largest room. At her insistence, a make-shift canopy had been stretched over
it. She thought: Those stupid men will have to place a mirror in this room and
a larger chest of drawers and a separate washroom if they expect me to spend
nights here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was difficult to
sleep. She found herself straining to hear possible sounds in the next room. He
couldn't get out, could he? The walls were sheer and impossibly high but
suppose the child could climb like a monkey? Well, Hoskins said there were
observational devices watching through the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Suddenly she thought:
Can he be dangerous? Physically dangerous?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Surely, Hoskins
couldn't have meant that. Surely, he would not have left her here alone, if—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She tried to laugh at
herself. He was only a three- or four-year-old child. Still, she had not
succeeded in cutting his nails. If he should attack her with nails and teeth
while she slept-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Her breath came
quickly. Oh, ridiculous, and yet—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She listened with
painful attentiveness, and this time she heard the sound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy was crying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Not shrieking in fear
or anger; not yelling or screaming. It was crying softly, and the cry was the
heartbroken sobbing of a lonely, lonely child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For the first time,
Miss Fellowes thought with a pang: Poor thing!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Of course, it was a
child; what did the shape of its head matter? It was a child that had been orphaned
as no child had ever been orphaned before. Not only its mother and father were
gone, but all its species. Snatched callously out of time, it was now the only
creature of its kind in the world. The last. The only.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She felt pity for it
strengthen, and with it shame at her own callousness. Tucking her own nightgown
carefully about her calves (incongruously, she thought: Tomorrow I'll have to
bring in a bathrobe) she got out of bed and went into the boy's room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Little
boy,&quot; she called in a whisper. &quot;Little boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She was about to reach
under the bed, but she thought of a possible bite and did not. Instead, she
turned on the night light and moved the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The poor thing was
huddled in the corner, knees up against his chin, looking up at her with
blurred and apprehensive eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In the dim light, she
was not aware of his repulsiveness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Poor boy,&quot;
she said, &quot;poor boy.&quot; She felt him stiffen as she stroked his hair,
then relax. &quot;Poor boy. May I hold you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She sat down on the
floor next to him and slowly and rhythmically stroked his hair, his cheek, his
arm. Softly, she began to sing a slow and gentle song.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He lifted his head at
that, staring at her mouth in the dimness, as though wondering at the sound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She maneuvered him
closer while he listened to her. Slowly, she pressed gently against the side of
his head, until it rested on her shoulder. She put her arm under his thighs and
with a smooth and unhurried motion lifted him into her lap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She continued singing,
the same simple verse over and over, while she rocked back and forth, back and
forth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stopped crying, and
after a while the smooth burr of his breathing showed he was asleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>With infinite care,
she pushed his bed back against the wall and laid him down. She covered him and
stared down. His face looked so peaceful and little-boy as he slept. It didn't
matter so much that it was so ugly. Really.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She began to tiptoe
out, then thought: If he wakes up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She came back, battled
irresolutely with herself, then sighed and slowly got into bed with the child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was too small for
her. She was cramped and uneasy at the lack of canopy, but the child's hand
crept into hers and, somehow, she fell asleep in that position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She awoke with a start
and a wild impulse to scream. The latter she just managed to suppress into a
gurgle. The boy was looking at her, wide-eyed. It took her a long moment to
remember getting into bed with him, and now, slowly, without unfixing her eyes from
his, she stretched one leg carefully and let it touch the floor, then the other
one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She cast a quick and
apprehensive glance toward the open ceiling, then tensed her muscles for quick
disengagement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But at that moment,
the boy's stubby fingers reached out and touched her lips. He said something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She shrank at the
touch. He was terribly ugly in the light of day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy spoke again.
He opened his own mouth and gestured with his hand as though something were
coming out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes guessed
at the meaning and said tremulously, &quot;Do you want me to sing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The boy said nothing
but stared at her mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In a voice slightly
off key with tension, Miss Fellowes began the little song she had sung the
night before and the ugly little boy smiled. He swayed clumsily in rough time
to the music and made a little gurgly sound that might have been the beginnings
of a laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes sighed
inwardly. Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast. It might help—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;You
wait. Let me get myself fixed up. It will just take a minute. Then I'll make
breakfast for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She worked rapidly,
conscious of the lack of ceiling at all times. The boy remained in bed,
watching her when she was in view. She smiled at him at those times and waved.
At the end, he waved back, and she found herself being charmed by that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Finally, she said,
&quot;Would you like oatmeal with milk?&quot; It took a moment to prepare, and
then she beckoned to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Whether he understood
the gesture or followed the aroma, Miss Fellowes did not know, but he got out of
bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She tried to show him
how to use a spoon but he shrank away from it in fright. (Time enough, she
thought.) She compromised on insisting that he lift the bowl in his hands. He
did it clumsily enough and it was incredibly messy but most of it did get into
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She tried the drinking
milk in a glass this time, and the little boy whined when he found the opening
too small for him to get his face into conveniently. She held his hand, forcing
it around the glass, making him tip it, forcing his mouth to the rim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Again a mess but again
most went into him, and she was used to messes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The washroom, to her
surprise and relief, was a less frustrating matter. He understood what it was
she expected him to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She found herself
patting his head, saying, &quot;Good boy. Smart boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And to Miss Fellowes'
exceeding pleasure, the boy smiled at that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She thought: when he
smiles, he's quite bearable. Really.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Later in the day, the
gentlemen of the press arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She held the boy in
her arms and he clung to her wildly while across the open door they set cameras
to work. The commotion frightened the boy and he began to cry, but it was ten
minutes before Miss Fellowes was allowed to retreat and put the boy in the next
room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She emerged again,
flushed with indignation, walked out of the apartment (for the first time in
eighteen hours) and closed the door behind her. &quot;I think you've had
enough. It will take me a while to quiet him. Go away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sure,
sure,&quot; said the gentleman from the <i>Times-Herald. </i>&quot;But is that
really a Neanderthal or is this some kind of gag?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I assure
you,&quot; said Hoskins' voice, suddenly, from the background, &quot;that this
is no gag. The child is authentic Homo neanderthalensis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Is it a boy or a
girl?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Boy,&quot; said
Miss Fellowes briefly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ape-boy,&quot;
said the gentleman from the <i>News. </i>&quot;That's what we've got here.
Ape-boy. How does he act, Nurse?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He acts exactly
like a little boy,&quot; snapped Miss Fellowes, annoyed into the defensive,
&quot;and he is not an ape-boy. His name is—is Timothy, Timmie—and he is
perfectly normal in his behavior.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She had chosen the
name Timothy at a venture. It was the first that had occurred to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>'Timmie the
Ape-boy,&quot; said the gentleman from the <i>News </i>and, as it turned out,
Timmie the Ape-boy was the name under which the child became known to the
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The gentleman from the
<i>Globe </i>turned to Hoskins and said, &quot;Doc, what do you expect to do
with the ape-boy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins shrugged.
&quot;My original plan was completed when I proved it possible to bring him here.
However, the anthropologists will be very interested, I imagine, and the
physiologists. We have Here, after all, a creature which is at the edge of
being human. We should learn a great deal about ourselves and our ancestry from
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How long will
you keep him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Until such a
time as we need the space more than we need him. Quite a while, perhaps.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The gentleman from the
<i>News </i>said, &quot;Can you bring it out into the open, so we can set up
sub-etheric equipment and put on a real show?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm sorry, but
the child cannot be removed from Stasis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Exactly what is
Stasis?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ah.&quot;
Hoskins permitted himself one of his short smiles. &quot;That would take a
great deal of explanation, gentlemen. In Stasis, time as we know it doesn't
exist. Those rooms are inside an invisible bubble that is not exactly part of
our Universe. That is why the child could be plucked out of time as it
was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, wait
now,&quot; said the gentleman from the <i>News </i>discontentedly, &quot;what
are you giving us? The nurse goes into the room and out of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And so can any
of you,&quot; said Hoskins matter-of-factly. &quot;You would be moving parallel
to the lines of temporal force and no great energy gain or loss would be
involved. The child, however, was taken from the far past. It moved across the
lines and gained temporal potential. To move it into the Universe and into our
own time would absorb enough energy to burn out every line in the place and
probably blank out all power in the city of Washington. We had to store trash
brought with him on the premises and will have to remove it little by
little.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The newsmen were
writing down sentences busily as Hoskins spoke to them. They did not understand
and they were sure their readers would not, but it sounded scientific and that
was what counted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The gentleman from the
<i>Times-Herald </i>said, &quot;Would you be available for an all-circuit
interview tonight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I think
so,&quot; said Hoskins at once, and they all moved off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes looked
after them. She understood all this about Stasis and temporal force as little
as the newsmen but she managed to get this much. Timmie's imprisonment (she
found herself suddenly thinking of the little boy as Timmie) was a real one and
not one imposed by the arbitrary fiat of Hoskins. Apparently, it was impossible
to let him out of Stasis at all, ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Poor child. Poor
child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She was suddenly aware
of his crying and she hastened in to console him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes did not
have a chance to see Hoskins on the all-circuit hookup, and though his
interview was beamed to every part of the world and even to the outpost on the
Moon, it did not penetrate the apartment in which Miss Fellowes and the ugly
little boy lived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But he was down the
next morning, radiant and joyful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;Did the interview go well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Extremely. And
how is—Timmie?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes found
herself pleased at the use of the name. &quot;Doing quite well. Now come out
here, Timmie, the nice gentleman will not hurt you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Timmie stayed in
the other room, with a lock of his matted hair showing behind the barrier of
the door and, occasionally, the corner of an eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Actually,&quot;
said Miss Fellowes, &quot;he is settling down amazingly. He is quite
intelligent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you
surprised?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She hesitated just a
moment, then said, &quot;Yes, I am. I suppose I thought he was an
ape-boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, ape-boy or
not, he's done a great deal for us. He's put Stasis, Inc. on the map. We're in,
Miss Fellowes, we're in.&quot; It was as though he had to express his triumph
to someone, even if only to Miss Fellowes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh?&quot; She
let him talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He put his hands in
his pockets and said, &quot;We've been working on a shoestring for ten years,
scrounging funds a penny at a time wherever we could. We had to shoot the works
on one big show. It<b> </b>was everything, or nothing. And when I say the
works, I mean it. This attempt to bring in a Neanderthal took every cent we
could borrow or steal, and some of it <i>was </i>stolen—funds for other
projects, used for this one without permission. If that experiment hadn't
succeeded, I'd have been through.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said
abruptly, &quot;Is that why there are no ceilings?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Eh?&quot;
Hoskins looked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Was there no
money for ceilings?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh. Well, that
wasn't the only reason. We didn't really know in advance how old the
Neanderthal might be exactly. We can detect only dimly in time, and he might
have been large and savage. It was possible we might have had to deal with him
from a distance, like a caged animal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But since that hasn't
turned out to be so, I suppose you can build a ceiling now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now, yes. We
have plenty of money, now. Funds have been promised from every source. This is
all wonderful, Miss Fellowes.&quot; His broad face gleamed with a smile that
lasted and when he left, even his back seemed to be smiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes thought:
He's quite a nice man when he's off guard and forgets about being scientific.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She wondered for an
idle moment if he was married, then dismissed the thought in
self-embarrassment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Timmie,&quot;
she called. &quot;Come here, Timmie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In the months that
passed, Miss Fellowes felt herself grow to be an integral part of Stasis, Inc.
She was given a small office of her own with her name on the door, an office
quite close to the dollhouse (as she never stopped calling Timmie's Stasis
bubble). She was given a substantial raise. The dollhouse was covered by a
ceiling; its furnishings were elaborated and improved; a second washroom was
added—and even so, she gained an apartment of her own on the institute grounds
and, on occasion, did not stay with Timmie during the night. An intercom was
set up between the dollhouse and her apartment and Timmie learned how to use
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes got used
to Timmie. She even grew less conscious of his ugliness. One day she found
herself staring at an ordinary boy in the street and finding something bulgy
and unattractive in his high domed forehead and jutting chin. She had to shake
herself to break the spell. It was more pleasant to grow used to Hoskins'
occasional visits. It was obvious he welcomed escape from his increasingly
harried role as head of Stasis, Inc., and that he took a sentimental interest
in the child who had started it all, but it seemed to Miss Fellowes that he
also enjoyed talking to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(She had learned some
facts about Hoskins, too. He had invented the method of analyzing the
reflection of the past-penetrating mesonic beam; he had invented the method of
establishing Stasis; his coldness was only an effort to hide a kindly nature;
and, oh yes, he <i>was </i>married.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>What Miss Fellowes
could <i>not </i>get used to was the fact that she was engaged in a scientific
experiment. Despite all she could do, she found herself getting personally
involved to the point of quarreling with the physiologists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>On one occasion,
Hoskins came down and found her in the midst of a hot urge to kill. They had no
right; they had no <i>right</i>— Even if he <i>was </i>a Neanderthal, he still wasn't
an animal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She was staring after
them in a blind fury; staring out the open door and listening to Timmie's
sobbing, when she noticed Hoskins standing before her. He might have been there
for minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;May I
come in?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She nodded curtly,
then hurried to Timmie, who clung to her, curling his little bandy legs—still
thin, so thin— about her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins watched, then
said gravely, &quot;He seems quite unhappy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;I don't blame him. They're at him every day now with their blood samples
and their probings. They keep him on synthetic diets that I wouldn't feed a
pig.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's the sort of
thing they can't try on a human, you know<i>.&quot;             </i><sup>:</sup></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And they can't
try it on Timmie, either. Dr. Hoskins, I insist. You told me it was Timmie's
coming that put Stasis, Inc. on the map. If you have any gratitude for that at
all, you've <i>got </i>to keep them away from the poor thing at least until
he's old enough to understand a little more. After he's had a bad session with
them, he has nightmares, he can't sleep. Now I warn you,&quot; (she reached a
sudden peak of fury) &quot;I'm not letting them in here any more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(She realized that she
had screamed that, but she couldn't help it.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said more quietly,
&quot;I know he's Neanderthal but there's a great deal we don't appreciate
about Neanderthals. I've read up on them. They had a culture of their own. Some
of the greatest human inventions arose in Neanderthal times. The domestication
of animals, for instance; the wheel; various techniques in grinding stone. They
even had spiritual yearnings. They buried their dead and buried possessions
with the body, showing they believed in a life after death. It amounts to the
fact that they invented religion. Doesn't that mean Timmie has a right to human
treatment?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She patted the little
boy gently on his buttocks and sent him off into his playroom. As the door was
opened, Hoskins smiled briefly at the display of toys that could be seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said
defensively, &quot;The poor child deserves his toys. It's all he has and he
earns them with what he goes through.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, no. No
objections, I assure you. I was just thinking how you've changed since the
first day, when you were quite angry I had foisted a Neanderthal on you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said in
a low voice, &quot;I suppose I didn't—&quot; and faded off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins changed the
subject, &quot;How old would you say he is, Miss Fellowes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;I
can't say, since we don't know how Neanderthals develop. In size, he'd only be
three but Neanderthals are smaller generally and with all the tampering they do
with him, he probably isn't growing. The way he's learning English, though, I'd
say he was well over four.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Really? I
haven't noticed anything about learning English in the reports.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He won't speak
to anyone but me. For now, anyway. He's terribly afraid of others, and no
wonder. But he can ask for an article of food; he can indicate any need
practically; and he understands almost anything I say. Of course,&quot; (she
watched him shrewdly, trying to estimate if this was the time), &quot;his
development may not continue.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Any child needs
stimulation and this one lives a life of solitary confinement. I do what I can,
but I'm not with him all the time and I'm not all he needs. What I mean, Dr.
Hoskins, is that he needs another boy to play with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins nodded slowly.
&quot;Unfortunately, there's only one of him, isn't there? Poor child.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes warmed
to him at once. She said, &quot;You do like Timmie, don't you?&quot; It was so
nice to have someone else feel like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot;
said Hoskins, and with his guard down, she could see the weariness in his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes dropped
her plans to push the matter at once. She said, with real concern, &quot;You
look worn out, Dr. Hoskins.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Do I, Miss

Stasis, Inc. is very busy and that that keeps you very busy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins shrugged.
&quot;You suppose right. It's a matter of  animal, vegetable, and mineral in
equal parts, Miss Fellowes. But then, I suppose you haven't ever seen our
displays.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Actually, I
haven't. —But it's not because I'm not interested. It's just that I've been so
busy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, you're not
all that busy right now,&quot; he said with impulsive decision. &quot;I'll call
for you tomorrow at eleven and give you a personal tour. How's that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She smiled happily.
&quot;I'd love it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He nodded and smiled
in his turn and left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes hummed
at intervals for the rest of the day. Really—to think so was ridiculous, of
course—but really, it was almost like—like making a date.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was quite on time
the next day, smiling and pleasant. She had replaced her nurse's uniform with a
dress. One of conservative cut, to be sure, but she hadn't felt so feminine in
years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He complimented her on
her appearance with staid formality and she accepted with equally formal grace.
It was really a perfect prelude, she thought. And then the additional thought
came, prelude to what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She shut that off by
hastening to say good-by to Timmie and to assure him she would be back soon.
She made sure he knew all about what and where lunch was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins took her into
the new wing, into which she had never yet gone. It still had the odor of
newness about it and the sound of construction, softly heard, was indication
enough that it was still being extended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Animal,
vegetable, and mineral,&quot; said Hoskins, as he had the day before.
&quot;Animal right there; our most spectacular exhibits.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The space was divided
into many rooms, each a separate Stasis bubble. Hoskins brought her to the
view-glass of one and she looked in. What she saw impressed her first as a
scaled, tailed chicken. Skittering on two thin legs it ran from wall to wall
with its delicate birdlike head, surmounted by a bony keel like the comb of a
rooster, looking this way and that. The paws on its small forelimbs clenched
and unclenched constantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;It's our dinosaur. We've had it for months. I don't know when we'll be
able to let go of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Dinosaur?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Did you expect a
giant?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She dimpled. &quot;One
does, I suppose. I know some of them are small.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A small one is
all we aimed for, believe me. Generally, it's under investigation, but this
seems to be an open hour. Some interesting things have been discovered. For
instance, it is not entirely cold-blooded. It has an imperfect method of
maintaining-internal temperatures higher than that of its environment.
Unfortunately, it's a male. Ever since we brought it in we've been trying to
get a fix on another that may be female, but we've had no luck yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why
female?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He looked at her
quizzically. &quot;So that we might have a fighting chance to obtain fertile
eggs, and baby dinosaurs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He led her to the
trilobite section. &quot;That's Professor Dwayne of Washington
University,&quot; he said. &quot;He's a nuclear chemist. If I recall correctly,
he's taking an isotope ratio on the oxygen of the water.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's primeval
water; at least half a billion years old. The isotope ratio gives the
temperature of the ocean at that time. He himself happens to ignore the
trilobites, but  others are chiefly concerned in dissecting them. They're the
lucky ones because all they need are scalpels and microscopes. Dwayne has to
set up a mass spectrograph each time he conducts an experiment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why's that?
Can't he—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, he can't. He
can't take anything out of the room as far as can be helped.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There were samples of
primordial plant life too and chunks of rock formations. Those were the
vegetable and mineral. And every specimen had its investigator. It was like a
museum; a museum brought to life and serving as a superactive center of
research.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;And you have to
supervise all of this, Dr. Hoskins?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Only indirectly,
Miss Fellowes. I have subordinates, thank heaven. My own interest is entirely
in the theoretical aspects of the matter: the nature of Time, the technique of
mesonic intertemporal detection and so on. I would exchange all this for a
method of detecting objects closer in Time than ten thousand years ago. If we
could get into historical times—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He was interrupted by
a commotion at one of the distant booths, a thin voice raised querulously. He
frowned, muttered hastily, &quot;Excuse me,&quot; and hastened off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes followed
as best she could without actually running.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>An elderly man,
thinly-bearded and red-faced, was saying, &quot;I had vital aspects of my
investigations to complete. Don't you understand that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A uniformed technician
with the interwoven SI monogram (for Stasis, Inc.) on his lab coat, said,
&quot;Dr. Hoskins, it was arranged with Professor Ademewski at the beginning
that the specimen could only remain here two weeks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I did not know
then how long my investigations would take. I'm not a prophet,&quot; said
Ademewski heatedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Hoskins said,
&quot;You understand, Professor, we have limited space; we must keep specimens
rotating. That piece of chalcopyrite must go back; there are men waiting for
the next specimen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why can't I have
it for myself, then? Let me take it out of there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You know you
can't have it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;A piece of
chalcopyrite; a miserable five-kilogram piece? Why not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We can't afford
the energy expense!&quot; said Hoskins brusquely. &quot;You know that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The technician
interrupted. &quot;The point is, Dr. Hoskins, that he tried to remove the rock
against the rules and I almost punctured Stasis while he was in there, not
knowing he was in there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was a short
silence and Dr. Hoskins turned on the investigator with a cold formality.
&quot;Is that so, Professor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Professor Ademewski
coughed. &quot;I saw no harm—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins reached up to
a hand-pull dangling just within reach, outside the specimen room in question.
He pulled it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes, who had
been peering in, looking at the totally undistinguished sample of rock that
occasioned the dispute, drew in her breath sharply as its existence flickered
out. The room was empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;Professor, your permit to investigate matters in Stasis will be
permanently voided. I am sorry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But wait—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I am sorry. You
have violated one of the stringent rules.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I will appeal to
the International Association—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Appeal away. In
a case like this, you will find I can't be overruled.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He turned away
deliberately, leaving the professor still protesting and said to Miss Fellowes
(his face still white with anger), &quot;Would you care to have lunch with me,
Miss Fellowes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He took her into the
small administration alcove of the cafeteria. He greeted others and introduced
Miss Fellowes with complete ease, although she herself felt painfully
self-conscious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>What must they think,
she thought, and tried desperately to appear businesslike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;Do you
have that kind of trouble often, Dr. Hoskins? I mean like that you just had
with the professor?&quot; She took her fork in hand and began eating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No,&quot; said
Hoskins forcefully. &quot;That was the first time. Of course I'm always having
to argue men out of removing specimens but this is the first time one actually
tried to <i>do </i>it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I remember you
once talked about the energy it would consume.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's right. Of
course, we've tried to take it into account. Accidents will happen and so we've
got special power sources designed to stand the drain of accidental removal
from Stasis, but that doesn't mean we want to see a year's supply of energy
gone in half a second—or can afford to without having our plans of expansion
delayed for years.—Besides, imagine the professor's being in the room while
Stasis was about to be punctured.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What would have
happened to him if it had been?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, we've
experimented with inanimate objects and with mice and they've disappeared.
Presumably they've traveled back in time; carried along, so to speak, by the
pull of the object simultaneously snapping back into its natural time. For that
reason, we have to anchor objects within Stasis that we don't want to move and
that's a complicated procedure. The professor would not have been anchored and
he would have gone back to the Pliocene at the moment when we abstracted the
rock— plus, of course, the two weeks it had remained here in the present.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;How dreadful it
would have been.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not on account
of the professor, I assure you. If he were fool enough to do what he did, it
would serve him right. But imagine the effect it would have on the public if
the fact came out. All people would need is to become aware of the dangers
involved and funds could be choked off like that.&quot; He snapped his fingers
and played moodily with his food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;Couldn't you get him back? The way you got the rock in the first
place?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, because once
an object is returned, the original fix is lost unless we deliberately plan to
retain it and there was no reason to do that in this case. There never is.
Finding the professor again would mean relocating a specific fix and that would
be like dropping a line into the oceanic abyss for the purpose of dredging up a
particular fish.—My God, when I think of the precautions we take to prevent
accidents, it makes me mad. We have every individual Stasis unit set up with
its own puncturing device—we have to, since each unit has its separate fix and
must be collapsible independently. The point is, though, none of the puncturing
devices is ever activated until the last minute. And then we deliberately make activation
impossible except by the pull of a rope carefully led outside the Stasis. The
pull is a gross mechanical motion that requires a strong effort, not something
that is likely to be done accidentally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;But doesn't it—change history to move something in and out of Time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins shrugged.
&quot;Theoretically, yes; actually, except in unusual cases, no. We move
objects out of Stasis all the time. Air molecules. Bacteria. Dust. About 10
percent of our energy consumption goes to make up micro-losses of that nature. But
moving even large objects in Time sets up changes that damp out. Take that
chalcopyrite from the Pliocene. Because of its absence for two weeks some
insect didn't find the shelter it might have found and is killed. That could
initiate a whole series of changes, but the mathematics of Stasis indicates
that this is a converging series. The amount of change diminishes with time and
then things are as before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean,
reality heals itself?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;In a manner of
speaking. Abstract a human from time or send one back, and you make a larger
wound. If the individual is an ordinary one, that wound still heals itself. Of
course, there are a great many people who write to us each day and want us to
bring Abraham Lincoln into the present, or Mohammed, or Lenin. <i>That </i>can't
be done, of course. Even if we could find them, the change in reality in moving
one of the history molders would be too great to be healed. There are ways of
calculating when a change is likely to be too great and we avoid even
approaching that limit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;Then, Timmie—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, he presents
no problem in that direction. Reality is safe. But—&quot; He gave her a quick,
sharp glance, then went on, &quot;But never mind. Yesterday you said Timmie
needed companionship.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes,&quot; Miss
Fellowes smiled her delight. &quot;I didn't think you paid that any
attention.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course I did.
I'm fond of the child. I appreciate your feelings for him and I was concerned
enough to want to explain to you. Now I have; you've seen what we do; you've
gotten some insight into the difficulties involved; so you know why, with the
best will in the world, we can't supply companionship for Timmie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You can't?&quot;
said Miss Fellowes, with sudden dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But I've just
explained. We couldn't possibly expect to find another Neanderthal his age
without incredible luck, and if we could, it wouldn't be fair to multiply risks
by having another human being in Stasis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes put down
her spoon and said energetically, &quot;But, Dr. Hoskins, that is not at all
what I meant. I don't want you to bring another Neanderthal into the present. I
know that's impossible. But it isn't impossible to bring another child to play
with Timmie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins stared at her
in concern. &quot;A <i>human </i>child?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span

Fellowes, completely hostile now. &quot;Timmie is human.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I couldn't dream
of such a thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Why not? Why
couldn't you? What is wrong with the notion? You pulled that child out of Time
and made him an eternal prisoner. Don't you owe him something? Dr. Hoskins, if
there is any man who, in this world, is that child's father in every sense but
the biological, it is you. Why can't you do this little thing for him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;His <i>father?&quot; </i>He rose, somewhat unsteadily, to his feet.
&quot;Miss Fellowes, I think I'll take you back now, if you don't mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They returned to the
dollhouse in a complete silence that neither broke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was a long time
after that before she saw Hoskins again, except for an occasional glimpse in
passing. She was sorry about that at times; then, at other times, when Timmie
was more than usually woebegone or when he spent silent hours at the window
with its prospect of little more than nothing, she thought, fiercely: Stupid
man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Timmie's speech grew
better and more precise each day. It never entirely lost a certain soft,
slurriness that Miss Fellowes found rather endearing. In times of excitement,
he fell back into tongue-clicking but those times were becoming fewer. He must
be forgetting the days before he came into the present—except for dreams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>As he grew older, the
physiologists grew less interested and the psychologists more so. Miss Fellowes
was not sure that she did not like the new group even less than the first. The
needles were gone; the injections and withdrawals of fluid; the special diets.
But now Timmie was made to overcome barriers to reach food and water. He had to
lift panels, move bars, reach for cords. And the mild electric shocks made him
cry and drove Miss Fellowes to distraction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She did not wish to
appeal to Hoskins; she did not wish to have to go to him; for each time she
thought of him, she thought of his face over the luncheon table that last time.
Her eyes moistened and she thought: Stupid, <i>stupid </i>man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And then one day
Hoskins' voice sounded unexpectedly, calling into the dollhouse, &quot;Miss
Fellowes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She came out coldly,
smoothing her nurse's uniform, then stopped in confusion at finding herself in
the presence of a pale woman, slender and of middle height. The woman's fair
hair and complexion gave her an appearance of fragility. Standing behind her
and clutching at her skirt was a round-faced, large-eyed child of four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;Dear, this is Miss Fellowes, the nurse in charge of the boy. Miss
Fellowes, this is my wife.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(Was this his wife?
She was not as Miss Fellowes had imagined her to be. But then, why not? A man
like Hoskins would choose a weak thing to be his foil. If that was what he
wanted—)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She forced a
matter-of-fact greeting. &quot;Good afternoon, Mrs. Hoskins. Is this your—your
little boy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(That </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>was a surprise. She
had thought of Hoskins as a husband, but not as a father, except, of course—
She suddenly caught Hoskins' grave eyes and flushed.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;Yes, this is my boy, Jerry. Say hello to Miss Fellowes, Jerry.&quot; .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(Had he stressed the
word &quot;this&quot; just a bit? Was he saying <i>this </i>was his son and not—)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerry receded a bit
further into the folds of the maternal skirt and muttered his hello. Mrs.
Hoskins' eyes were searching over Miss Fellowes' shoulders, peering into the
room, looking for something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins said,
&quot;Well, let's go in. Come, dear. There's a trifling discomfort at the
threshold, but it passes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;Do you want Jerry to come in, too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Of course. He is
to be Timmie's playmate. You said that Timmie needed a playmate. Or have you
forgotten?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But—&quot; She
looked at him with a colossal, surprised wonder. <i>&quot;Your </i>boy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said peevishly,
&quot;Well, whose boy, then? Isn't this what you want? Come on in, dear. Come
on in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mrs. Hoskins lifted
Jerry into her arms with a distinct effort and, hesitantly, stepped over the
threshold. Jerry squirmed as she did so, disliking the sensation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mrs. Hoskins said in a
thin voice, &quot;Is the creature here? I don't see him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes called,
&quot;Timmie. Come out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Timmie peered around
the edge of the door, staring up at the little boy who was visiting him. The
muscles in Mrs. Hoskins' arms tensed visibly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said to her
husband, &quot;Gerald, are you sure it's safe?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said at
once, &quot;If you mean is Timmie safe, why, of course he is. He's a gentle
little boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But he's a
sa—savage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(The ape-boy stories
in the newspapers!) Miss Fellowes said emphatically, &quot;He is not a savage.
He is just as quiet and reasonable as you can possibly expect a
five-and-a-half-year-old to be. It is very generous of you, Mrs. Hoskins, to
agree to allow your boy to play with Timmie but please have no fears about
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mrs. Hoskins said with
mild heat, &quot;I'm not sure that I agree.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;We've had it
out, dear,&quot; said Hoskins. &quot;Let's not bring up the matter for new
argument. Put Jerry down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mrs. Hoskins did so
and the boy backed against her, staring at the pair of eyes which were staring
back at him from the next room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Come here,
Timmie,&quot; said Miss Fellowes. &quot;Don't be afraid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Slowly, Timmie stepped
into the room. Hoskins bent to disengage Jerry's fingers from his mother's
skirt. &quot;Step back, dear. Give the children a chance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The youngsters faced
one another. Although the younger, Jerry was nevertheless an inch taller, and
in the presence of his straightness and his high-held, well-proportioned head,
Timmie's grotesqueries were suddenly almost as pronounced as they had been in
the first days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes' lips
quivered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was the little
Neanderthal who spoke first, in childish treble. &quot;What's your name?&quot;
And Timmie thrust his face suddenly forward as though to inspect the other's
features more closely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Startled Jerry
responded with a vigorous shove that sent Timmie tumbling. Both began crying
loudly and Mrs. Hoskins snatched up her child, while Miss Fellowes, flushed
with repressed anger, lifted Timmie and comforted him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mrs. Hoskins said,
&quot;They just instinctively don't like one another.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No more
instinctively,&quot; said her husband wearily, &quot;than any two children
dislike each other. Now put Jerry down and let him get used to the situation.
In fact, we had better leave. Miss Fellowes can bring Jerry to my office after
a while and I'll have him taken home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>The two children spent
the next hour very aware of each other. Jerry cried for his mother, struck out
at Miss Fellowes and, finally, allowed himself to be comforted with a lollipop.
Timmie sucked at another, and at the end of an hour, Miss Fellowes had them
playing with the same set of blocks, though at opposite ends of the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She found herself
almost maudlinly grateful to Hoskins when she brought Jerry to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She searched for ways
to thank him but his very formality was a rebuff. Perhaps he could not forgive
her for making him feel like a cruel father. Perhaps the bringing of his own
child was an attempt, after all, to prove himself both a kind father to Timmie
and, also, not his father at all. Both at the same time!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So all she could say
was, &quot;Thank you. Thank you very much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And all he could say
was, &quot;It's all right. Don't mention it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It became a settled
routine. Twice a week, Jerry was brought in for an hour's play, later extended
to two hours' play. The children learned each other's names and ways and played
together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And yet, after the
first rush of gratitude, Miss Fellowes found herself disliking Jerry. He was
larger and heavier and in all things dominant, forcing Timmie into a completely
secondary role. All that reconciled her to the situation was the fact that,
despite difficulties, Timmie looked forward with more and more delight to the
periodic appearances of his playfellow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was all he had, she
mourned to herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And once, as she
watched them, she thought: Hoskins' two children, one by his wife and one by
Stasis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>While she herself—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Heavens, she thought,
putting her fists to her temples and feeling ashamed: I'm jealous!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Miss
Fellowes,&quot; said Timmie (carefully, she had never allowed him to call her
anything else) &quot;when will I go to school?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><a name=one></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She looked down at
those eager brown eyes turned up to hers and passed her hand softly through his
thick, curly hair. It was the most disheveled portion of his appearance, for
she cut his hair herself while he sat restlessly under the scissors. She did
not ask for professional help, for the very clumsiness of the cut served to
mask the retreating fore part of the skull and the bulging hinder part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;Where
did you hear about school?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Jerry goes to
school. Kin-der-gar-ten.&quot; He said it carefully. &quot;There are lots of
places he goes. Outside. When can I go outside, Miss Fellowes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A small pain centered
in Miss Fellowes' heart. Of course, she saw, there would be no way of avoiding
the inevitability of Timmie's hearing more and more of the outer world he could
never enter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, with an attempt
at gaiety, &quot;Why, whatever would you do in kindergarten, Timmie?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Jerry says they
play games, they have picture tapes. He says there are lots of children. He
says—he says—&quot; A thought, then a triumphant upholding of both small hands
with the fingers splayed apart. &quot;He says this many.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes said,
&quot;Would you like picture tapes? I can get you picture tapes. Very nice
ones. And music tapes too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So that Timmie was
temporarily comforted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He pored over the
picture tapes in Jerry's absence and Miss Fellowes read to him out of ordinary
books by the hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was so much to
explain in even the simplest story, so much that was outside the perspective of
his three rooms. Timmie took to having his dreams more often now that the
outside was being introduced to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were always the
same, about the outside. He tried haltingly to describe them to Miss Fellowes.
In his dreams, he was outside, an empty outside, but very large, with children
and queer indescribable objects half-digested in his thought out of bookish
descriptions half-understood, or out of distant Neanderthal memories
half-recalled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But the children and
objects ignored him and though he was in the world, he was never part of it,
but was as alone as though he were in his own room—and would wake up crying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes tried to
laugh at the dreams, but there were nights in her own apartment when she cried,
too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>One day, as Miss Fellowes
read, Timmie put his hand under her chin and lifted it gently so that her eyes
left the book and met his.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said, &quot;How do
you know what to say, Miss Fellowes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;You
see these marks? They tell me what to say. These marks make words.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He stared at them long
and curiously, taking the book out of her hands. &quot;Some of these marks are
the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She laughed with
pleasure at this sign of his shrewdness and said, &quot;So they are. Would you
like to have me show you how to make the marks?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;All right. That
would be a nice game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It did not occur to
her that he could learn to read. Up to the very moment that he read a book to
her, it did not occur to her that he could learn to read.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Then, weeks later, the
enormity of what had been done struck her. Timmie sat in her lap, following
word by word the printing in a child's book, reading to her. He was reading to
her!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She struggled to her
feet in amazement and said, &quot;Now Timmie, I'll be back later. I want to see
Dr. Hoskins.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Excited nearly to
frenzy, it seemed to her she might have an answer to Timmie's unhappiness. If
Timmie could not leave to enter the world, the world must be brought into those
three rooms to Timmie—the whole world in books and film and sound. He must be
educated to his full capacity. So much the world owed him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She found Hoskins in a
mood that was oddly analogous to her own; a kind of triumph and glory. His
offices were unusually busy, and for a moment, she thought she would not get to
see him, as she stood abashed in the anteroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But he saw her, and a
smile spread over his broad face. &quot;Miss Fellowes, come here.&quot; He
spoke rapidly into the intercom, then shut it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Have you heard?—No,
of course, you couldn't have.  We've done it. We've actually done it. We have
intertemporal detection at close range.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You mean,&quot;
she tried to detach her thought from her own good news for a moment, &quot;that
you can get a person from historical times into the present?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's just what
I mean. We have a fix on a fourteenth century individual right now. Imagine. <i>Imagine!
</i>If you could only know how glad I'll be to shift from the eternal
concentration on the Mesozoic, replace the paleontologists with the historians—But
there's something you wish to say to me, eh? Well, go ahead; go ahead. You find
me in a good mood. Anything you want you can have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes smiled.
&quot;I'm glad. Because I wonder if we might not establish a system of
instruction for Timmie?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Instruction? In
what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well, in
everything. A school. So that he might learn.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;But <i>can </i>he
learn?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Certainly, he <i>is
</i>learning. He can read. I've taught him so much myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins sat there,
seeming suddenly depressed. &quot;I don't know, Miss Fellowes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;You
just said that anything I wanted—&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know and I
should not have. You see, Miss Fellowes, I'm sure you must realize that we
cannot maintain the Timmie experiment forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She stared at him with
sudden horror, not really understanding what he had said. How did he mean
&quot;cannot maintain&quot;? With an agonizing flash of recollection, she
recalled Professor Ademewski and his mineral specimen that was taken away after
two weeks. She said, &quot;But you're talking about a boy. Not about a
rock—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Dr. Hoskins said
uneasily, &quot;Even a boy can't be given undue importance, Miss Fellowes. Now
that we expect individuals out of historical time, we will need Stasis space,
all we can get.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She didn't grasp it.
&quot;But you can't. Timmie—Timmie—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Now, Miss
Fellowes, please don't upset yourself. Timmie won't go right away; perhaps not
for months. Meanwhile we'll do what we can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She was still staring
at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Let me get you
something, Miss Fellowes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No,&quot; she
whispered. &quot;I don't need anything.&quot; She arose in a kind of nightmare
and left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Timmie, she thought,
you will <i>not </i>die. You will <i>not </i>die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was all very well
to hold tensely to the thought that Timmie must not die, but how was that to be
arranged? In the first weeks, Miss Fellowes clung only to the hope that the
attempt to bring forward a man from the fourteenth century would fail
completely. Hoskins' theories might be wrong or his practice defective. Then
things could go on as before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Certainly, that was
not the hope of the rest of the world and, irrationally, Miss Fellowes hated
the world for it. &quot;Project Middle Ages&quot; reached a climax of white-hot
publicity. The press and the public had hungered for something like this.
Stasis, Inc. had lacked the necessary sensation for a long time now. A new rock
or another ancient fish failed to stir them. But <i>this </i>was <i>it.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A historical human; an
adult speaking a known language; someone who could open a new page of history
to the scholar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Zero-time was coming
and this time it was not a question of three onlookers from the balcony. This
time there would be a world-wide audience. This time the technicians of Stasis,
Inc. would play their role before nearly all of mankind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes was
herself all but savage with waiting. When young Jerry Hoskins showed up for his
scheduled playtime with Timmie, she scarcely recognized him. He was not the one
she was waiting for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>(The secretary who
brought him left hurriedly after the barest nod for Miss Fellowes. She was
rushing for a good place from which to watch the climax of Project Middle Ages.
—And so ought Miss Fellowes with far better reason, she thought bitterly, if
only that stupid girl would arrive.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerry Hoskins sidled
toward her, embarrassed. &quot;Miss Fellowes?&quot; He took the reproduction of
a news-strip out of his pocket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes? What is it,
Jerry?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Is this a
picture of Timmie?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes stared at
him, then snatched the strip from Jerry's hand. The excitement of Project
Middle Ages had brought about a pale revival of interest in Timmie on the part
of the press.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerry watched her
narrowly, then said, &quot;It says Timmie is an ape-boy. What does that
mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes  caught
the youngster's wrist and repressed the impulse to shake him. &quot;Never say
that, Jerry, Never, do you understand? It is a nasty word and you mustn't use
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Jerry struggled out of
her grip, frightened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes tore up
the news-strip with a vicious twist of the wrist. &quot;Now go inside and play
with Timmie. He's got a new book to show you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And then, finally, the
girl appeared. Miss Fellowes did not know her. None of the usual stand-ins she
had used when businesss took her elsewhere was available now, not with Project
Middle Ages at climax, but Hoskins' secretary had promised to find <i>someone </i>and
this must be the girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes tried to
keep querulousness out of her voice. &quot;Are you the girl assigned to Stasis
Section One?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes, I'm Mandy
Terris. You're Miss Fellowes, aren't you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's
right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm sorry I'm
late. There's just so much excitement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I know. Now I
want you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandy said,
&quot;You'll be watching, I suppose.&quot; Her thin, vacuously pretty face
filled with envy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Never mind that.
Now I want you to come inside and meet Timmie and Jerry. They will be playing
for the next two hours so they'll be giving you no trouble. They've got milk
handy and plenty of toys. In fact, it will be better if you leave them alone as
much as possible. Now I'll show you where everything is located and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Is it Timmie
that's the ape-b—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Timmie is the
Stasis subject,&quot; said Miss Fellowes firmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I mean, he's the
one who's not supposed to get out, is that right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes. Now, come
in. There isn't much time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And when she finally
left, Mandy Terris called after her shrilly, &quot;I hope you get a good seat
and, golly, I sure hope it works.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes did not
trust herself to make a reasonable response. She hurried on without looking
back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But the delay meant
she did <i>not </i>get a good seat. She got no nearer than the
wall-viewing-plate in the assembly hall. Bitterly, she regretted that. If she
could have been on the spot; if she could somehow have reached out for some
sensitive portion of the instrumentations; if she were in some way able to
wreck the experiment—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She found the strength
to beat down her madness. Simple destruction would have done no good. They
would have rebuilt and reconstructed and made the effort again. And she would
never be allowed to return to Timmie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Nothing would help.
Nothing but that the experiment itself fail; that it break down irretrievably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>So she waited through
the countdown, watching every move on the giant screen, scanning the faces of
the technicians as the focus shifted from one to the other, watching for the
look of worry and uncertainty that would mark something going unexpectedly
wrong; watching, watching—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There was no such
look. The count reached zero, and very quietly, very unassumingly, the
experiment succeeded!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>In the new Stasis that
had been established there stood a bearded, stoop-shouldered peasant of
indeterminate age, in ragged dirty clothing and wooden shoes, staring in dull
horror at the sudden mad change that had flung itself over him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And while the world
went mad with jubilation, Miss Fellowes stood frozen in sorrow, jostled and
pushed, all but trampled; surrounded by triumph while bowed down with defeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And when the
loud-speaker called her name with strident force, it sounded it three times
before she responded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Miss  Fellowes.

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Let me
through!&quot; she cried breathlessly, while the loud-speaker continued its
repetitions without pause. She forced her way through the crowds with wild
energy, beating at it, striking out with closed fists, flailing, moving toward
the door in a nightmare slowness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Mandy Terris was in
tears. &quot;I don't know how it happened. I just went down to the edge of the
corridor to watch a pocket-viewing-plate they had put up. Just for a minute.
And then before I could move or do anything—&quot; She cried out in sudden
accusation, &quot;You said they would make no trouble; you <i>said </i>to leave
them alone—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes,
disheveled and trembling uncontrollably, glared at her. &quot;Where's
Timmie?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>A nurse was swabbing
the arm of a wailing Jerry with disinfectant and another was preparing an
anti-tetanus shot. There was blood on Jerry's clothes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He bit me, Miss

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Miss Fellowes didn't
even see him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What did you do
with Timmie?&quot; she cried out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I locked him in
the bathroom,&quot; said Mandy. &quot;I just threw the little monster in there
and locked him in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes ran into
the dollhouse. She fumbled at the bathroom door. It took an eternity to get it

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Don't whip me,
Miss Fellowes,&quot; he whispered. His eyes were red. His lips were quivering.

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh, Timmie, who

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said tremulously,
&quot;She said, with a long rope. She said you would hit me and hit me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You won't be.

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;He called me an
ape-boy. He said I wasn't a real boy. He said I was an animal.&quot; Timmie
dissolved in a flood of tears. &quot;He said he wasn't going to play with a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He said I was all
funny-looking. He said I was horrible ugly. He kept saying and saying and I bit
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>They were both crying
now. Miss Fellowes sobbed, &quot;But it isn't true. You know that, Timmie.
You're a real boy. You're a dear real boy and the best boy in the world. And no
one, <i>no </i>one will ever take you away from me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was easy to make up
her mind, now; easy to know what to do. Only it had to be done quickly. Hoskins

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It would be an unusual
time for her to return but not an unheard of one. The guard knew her well and
would not dream of questioning her. He would think nothing of her carrying a

and the calm smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>He did. When she
entered the dollhouse again, Timmie was still awake, and she maintained a

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There would be few to
see her afterward, none to question the bundle she would be carrying. Timmie
would be very quiet and then it would be a <i>fait accompli. </i>It would be
done and what would be the use of trying to undo it. They would leave her be.
They would leave them both be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She opened the
suitcase, took out the overcoat, the woolen cap with the ear-flaps and the
rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Timmie said, with the
beginning of alarm, &quot;Why are you putting all these clothes on me, Miss
Fellowes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said, &quot;I am
going to take you outside, Timmie. To where your dreams are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;My dreams?&quot;
His face twisted in sudden yearning, yet fear was there, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;You won't be
afraid. You'll be with me. You won't be afraid if you're with me, will you,
Timmie?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, Miss Fellowes.&quot;
He buried his little misshapen head against her side, and under her enclosing
arm she could feel his small heart thud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>It was midnight and
she lifted him into her arms. She disconnected the alarm and opened the door
softly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And she screamed, for
facing her across the open door was Hoskins!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>There were two men
with him and he stared at her, as astonished as she.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes
recovered first by a second and made a quick attempt to push past him; but even
with the second's delay he had time. He caught her roughly and hurled her back
against a chest of drawers. He waved the men in and confronted her, blocking
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I didn't expect
this. Are you completely insane?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She had managed to
interpose her shoulder so that it, rather than Timmie, had struck the chest.
She said pleadingly, &quot;What harm can it do if I take him, Dr. Hoskins? You
can't put energy loss ahead of a human life?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Firmly, Hoskins took
Timmie out of her arms. &quot;An energy loss this size would mean millions of
dollars lost out of the pockets of investors. It would mean a terrible setback
for Stasis, Inc. It would mean eventual publicity about a sentimental nurse
destroying all that for the sake of an ape-boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Ape-boy!&quot; </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>said Miss Fellowes, in
helpless fury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's what the
reporters would call him,&quot; said Hoskins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>One of the men emerged
now, looping a nylon rope through eyelets along the upper portion of the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Miss Fellowes
remembered the rope that Hoskins had pulled outside the room containing
Professor Ademewski's rock specimen so long ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She cried out,
&quot;No!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>But Hoskins put Timmie
down and gently removed the overcoat he was wearing. &quot;You stay here,
Timmie. Nothing will happen to you. We're just going outside for a moment. All
right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Timmie, white and
wordless, managed to nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins steered Miss
Fellowes out of the dollhouse ahead of himself. For the moment, Miss Fellowes
was beyond resistance. Dully, she noticed the hand-pull being adjusted outside
the dollhouse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm sorry, Miss
Fellowes,&quot; said Hoskins. &quot;I would have spared you this. I planned it
for the night so that you would know only when it was over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She said in a weary
whisper, &quot;Because your son was hurt. Because he tormented this child into
striking out at him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No. Believe me.
I understand about the incident today and I know it was Jerry's fault. But the
story has leaked out. It would have to with the press surrounding us on this
day of all days. I can't risk having a distorted story about negligence and savage
Neanderthalers, so-called, distract from the success of Project Middle Ages.
Timmie has to go soon anyway; he might as well go now and give the
sensationalists as small a peg as possible on which to hang their trash.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;It's not like
sending a rock back. You'll be killing a human being.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Not killing.
There'll be no sensation. He'll simply be a Neanderthal boy in a Neanderthal
world. He will no longer be a prisoner and alien. He will have a chance at a
free life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;What chance?
He's only seven years old, used to being taken care of, fed, clothed,
sheltered. He will be alone. His tribe may not be at the point where he left
them now that four years have passed. And if they were, they would not
recognize him. He will have to take care of himself. How will he know
how?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins shook his head
in hopeless negative. &quot;Lord, Miss Fellowes, do you think we haven't
thought of that? Do you think we would have brought in a child if it weren't
that it was the first successful fix of a human or near-human we made and that
we did not dare to take the chance of unfixing him and finding another fix as
good? Why do you suppose we kept Timmie as long as we did, if it were not for
our reluctance to send a child back into the past? It's just&quot;—his voice
took on a desperate urgency —&quot;that we can wait no longer. Timmie stands in
the way of expansion! Timmie is a source of possible bad publicity; we are on
the threshold of great things, and I'm sorry, Miss Fellowes, but we can't let
Timmie block us. We cannot. We cannot. I'm sorry, Miss Fellowes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Well,
then,&quot; said Miss Fellowes sadly. &quot;Let me say good-by. Give me five
minutes to say good-by. Spare me that much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Hoskins hesitated.
&quot;Go ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Timmie ran to her. For
the last time he ran to her and for the last time Miss Fellowes clasped him in
her arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>For a moment, she
hugged him blindly. She caught at a chair with the toe of one foot, moved it
against the wall, sat down.   &quot;Don't be afraid, Timmie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;I'm not afraid
if you're here, Miss Fellowes. Is that man mad at me, the man out there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No, he isn't. He
just doesn't understand about us. —Timmie, do you know what a mother is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Like Jerry's
mother?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Did he tell you
about his mother?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Sometimes. I
think maybe a mother is a lady who takes care of you and who's very nice to you
and who does good things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;That's right.
Have you ever wanted a mother, Timmie?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>Timmie pulled his head
away from her so that he could look into her face. Slowly, he put his hand to
her cheek and hair and stroked her, as long, long ago she had stroked him. He
said, &quot;Aren't you my mother?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Oh,
Timmie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Are you angry
because I asked?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;No. Of course
not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Because I know
your name is Miss Fellowes, but—but sometimes, I call you 'Mother' inside. Is
that all right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Yes. Yes. It's
all right. And I won't leave you any more and nothing will hurt you. I'll be
with you to care for you always. Call me Mother, so I can hear you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>&quot;Mother,&quot;
said Timmie contentedly, leaning his cheek against hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>She rose, and, still
holding him, stepped up on the chair. The sudden beginning of a shout from
outside went unheard and, with her free hand, she yanked with all her weight at
the cord where it hung suspended between two eyelets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'>And Stasis was
punctured and the room was empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
