In the first place, Pearl Harbor put the United States in the war the day I wrote Time Pussy,' and those first two months after the debacle were too disastrous and heartbreaking to allow much in the way of fiction composing.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0035in; text-indent: 0.1299in"><span style="lang: en-US">If that in itself weren't enough, the time had come to try, once again, the qualifying examinations that would, or would not, grant me permission to do research. I very much felt myself to be dangling over the abyss. A second failure to pass would probably mean an end for me at Columbia. Consequently, during those hours when I wasn't working in my father's candy store or hanging over the radio, I had to be studying. There was time for nothing else at all.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0035in; text-indent: 0.1264in"><span style="lang: en-US">Hedging my bets rather desperately, I registered for graduate work at New York University, just in case I did not pass once again. After I took my qualifying examinations, at the end of January 1942, I actually attended a few classes at N.Y.U. while waiting for the results to be announced. - But I won't keep you in suspense. On Friday, the thirteenth of February, the results were announced. I had passed, this time.</span></p>

This was a positronic robot story that was a sequel to 'Not Final!' which had </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">not </span><span style="lang: en-US">been a positronic robot story. Obviously I was trying to ride the series notion all I could, in the hope of surer sales.</span></p>

Nor was he so impressed by 'Nightfall' and by my 'Foundation' series as to find himself incapable of making the rejection a severe one.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; text-indent: 0.1333in"><span style="lang: en-US">On February 13, the very day of my passing into the sacred list of those permitted to do research toward their Ph.D., my spirits were somewhat dashed when I received 'Victory Unintentional' back with a cryptic rejection, which consisted of the following, in toto, 'CH</span><span style="lang: en-US; vertical-align: subscript">S</span><span style="lang: en-US">C</span><span style="lang: en-US; vertical-align: subscript">2</span><span style="lang: en-US">CH</span><span style="lang: en-US; vertical-align: subscript">2</span><span style="lang: en-US">CH</span><span style="lang: en-US; vertical-align: subscript">2</span><span style="lang: en-US">SH.' Campbell very well knew that this was the formula for 'butyl mercaptan,' which gives the skunk its smell, and I very well knew it, too, and Campbell very well knew I knew.</span></p>

I managed to sell it anyway, to </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">Super Science Stories </span><span style="lang: en-US">under its post-Pohl editor, on March 16, 1942, and it appeared in the August 1942 issue of that magazine. Though I did not include it in </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">I</span><span style="lang: en-US">, </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">Robot, </span><span style="lang: en-US">I did include it, of necessity, in </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">The Rest of the Robots.</span></p>

Once 'Victory Unintentional' was finished, fourteen months (!) were to pass before I turned back to the typewriter. It was not the conventional 'writer's block,' of course, for that I have never experienced. Rather, it was the coming of a vast, triple change in my life.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0069in; text-indent: 0.1264in"><span style="lang: en-US">The first change was the fact that I was now beginning chemical research in earnest under Professor Charles R. Daw-son. Research is a full-time job and I still had to work it around, somehow, my duties in my father's candy store, .so there was bound to be very little time for writing.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0167in; text-indent: 0.1167in"><span style="lang: en-US">Then, as though that weren't enough, a second change took place simultaneously -</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0097in; text-indent: 0.1236in"><span style="lang: en-US">In January 1942 I joined an organization called 'The Brooklyn Writers' Club,' which had sent me a postcard of invitation. I took the invitation to be a recognition of my status as a 'writer' and I couldn't possibly have refused.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0167in; text-indent: 0.1236in"><span style="lang: en-US">The first meeting I attended was on January 19, 1942. It turned out to be rather pleasant. I welcomed the chance to get my mind off the qualifying examinations and the war disasters (though I remember spending part of that first meeting discussing the possibility that New York might be bombed).</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0264in; text-indent: 0.1236in"><span style="lang: en-US">Most of the members of the club were no further advanced in the profession than I was; nor were any of them, aside from myself, science fiction writers. The chief activity consisted of reading from our own manuscripts so that criticism from the others might be invited. Since it was quickly discovered that I read 'with expression,' I became chief reader, a role I enjoyed. (It was to be eight years yet before I discovered that I had a natural flair for the lecture platform.)</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0368in; text-indent: 0.1299in"><span style="lang: en-US">On February 9, 1942, the third meeting I attended, there was present a young man, Joseph Goldberger, whom I had not met</span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US"> </span><span style="lang: en-US">before. He was a couple of years older than I was. I did most of the reading that day and Goldberger was sufficiently impressed to suggest, after the meeting had adjourned, that the two of us, with our girls, go out on a double date and get to know each other. Embarrassed, I had to explain that I had no girl. With an expansive gesture, he said he would get one for me.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; text-indent: 0.1333in"><span style="lang: en-US">And so he did. On February 14, 1942, (Valentine's Day and the day after I had passed my qualifying examinations) I met him at the Astor Hotel at 8.30 p.m. With him was his girlfriend, and with her was </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">her </span><span style="lang: en-US">girl-friend, Gertrude Blugerman, who was going to be my blind date. -I fell in love, and when I wasn't thinking of research I was thinking of her.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0132in; text-indent: 0.1236in"><span style="lang: en-US">But there was also a third change, in a way the most drastic-</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0132in; text-indent: 0.1201in"><span style="lang: en-US">With war, the job situation suddenly changed: technically trained men of all sorts were in demand.</span></p>

His health had retired him from active service in the Navy and had kept him retired, but his Annapolis connections made it possible for him to work as a civilian engineer at the Naval Air Experimental Station of the U.S. Navy Yard in Philadelphia. He cast about for other qualified people he might persuade to join him there, particularly among his fellow science fiction writers.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0167in; text-indent: 0.1264in"><span style="lang: en-US">He got L. Sprague de Camp to come to the N.A.E.S., and on March 30, 1942, I received a letter from the navy yard asking if I would consider joining them.</span></p>

I was in love and I wanted to get married even more than I wanted my degree. It occurred to me that I could suspend work toward my Ph.D. with the full approval of the school, thanks to the war emergency, and that I could also get full permission to resume after the war. And by taking a job and postponing - merely </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">postponing - </span><span style="lang: en-US">my research, I could get married.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; margin-left: 0.0167in; text-indent: 0.1236in"><span style="lang: en-US">I went down to Philadelphia for an interview on April 10 and apparently met their requirements. I took the iob, and on May 14, having left my father's candy store at last and (at least as a worker) forever, I moved to Philadelphia. Fortunately, Philadelphia was only an hour and a half from New York by train (in those days, I couldn't drive a car and, even if I could, I wouldn't have been able to get the gasoline because of rationing). I was therefore back in New York every weekend.</span></p>

It was fun; it was exciting; and such success as I managed to achieve was deeply satisfying - but it had been done to serve a purpose and that purpose had been served. I had no notion that writing could be my career; that it could ever </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">possibly </span><span style="lang: en-US">be my career.</span></p>
   <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.0694in; margin-top: 0.0694in; margin-right: 0.0000in; text-indent: 0.1333in"><span style="lang: en-US">My career was to be chemistry. All the time I was writing and selling stories, I was also slaving away at Columbia. Once I earned my Ph.D., I intended to make my living by doing chemical research for some large industry at some munificent salary such as a hundred dollars a week. (As the son of a candy-store keeper, brought up in the depression, I suffered dizzy spells if I tried to think of more than a hundred dollars a week, so I confined my ambitions to that.)</span></p>

By my marriage day, I had written forty-two stories, of which twenty-eight had been sold (and three more were yet to sell). My total bachelor earnings over a space of four years had been $1,788.50 for those twenty-eight stories. This amounted to an average earning of just under $8.60 per week or $64 per story.</span></p>

It was the first time I had ever tried to write something for Campbell without conferences with him. I missed the inspiration that invariably came through talks with him; I missed his encouragement. In fact, I wasn't sure that I could write at all without him. So the story limped and there were dry spells. I didn't finish the first draft till March 5, and the final version wasn't ready for mailing till April 4, 1943.</span></p>

I mailed the story to Campbell on April 6, 1943 (the first time I ever </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">mailed </span><span style="lang: en-US">him a story instead of handing it to him), and on the twelfth the check of acceptance arrived. There was not even a revision requested, and what's more, Campbell paid me a bonus for the first time since 'Nightfall.' I received one and a quarter cents a word, or $ 150 in all. My sixth try at </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">Unknown </span><span style="lang: en-US">had succeeded.</span></p>

Bensen, however, shrugged them off and in his short introduction to the story said to .the readers, 'And don't worry about the references to the OP A and Selective Service - consider them as part of the historical setting, just as you would a bodkin or a furbelow in a story of an earlier time.'</span></p>

From what we see, the whole idea was to build up a positronic brain containing modifications of one or two of the fundamental axioms. We haven't worked out the details, but they must be minor, as it was the first experiment of this nature ever tried, and even the great mythical psychologists of that day had to progress stepwise.

You know what I mean. We humans used to be combative. But it's being bred out of us. A stable political and economic system doesn't encourage the waste energy of combat. It's not a survival factor. But suppose the robots are combative. Suppose as the result of a wrong turn during the millennia they've been unwatched, they've become far more combative than ever their first makers intended.

And furthermore, I have detected radiations of energy beyond that produced by uranium which must be due to traces of elements unknown to us but described by the Eekahs.

The solubilities of organic compounds in various solvents has become of particular interest in this connection through the recent discovery of the endochronic nature of thiotimoline.</span></p>

Where the physical characteristics of two given compounds - particularly the degree of subdivision of the material - are equal, then the time of solution - expressed in seconds per gram of material per milli-liter of solvent - decreases with the number of hydrophilic groups present. Catechol, for instance, with two hydroxy groups on the benzene nucleus, dissolves considerably more quickly than does phenol, with only one hydroxy group on the nucleus. Feinschreiber and Hravlek in their studies on the problem have contended that with increasing hydrophilism, the time of solution approaches zero. That this analysis is not entirely correct was shown when it was discovered that the compound thiotimoline will dissolve in water - in the proportions of 1 gm./ml. - in </span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US">minus </span><span style="lang: en-US">1.12 seconds.

The fact that the chemical dissolved prior to the addition of the water made the attempt natural to withdraw the water after solution and before addition. This, fortunately for the law of Conservation of Mass-Energy, never succeeded, since solution never took place unless the water was eventually added. The question is, of course, instantly raised as to how the thiotimoline can 'know' in advance whether the water will ultimately be added or not. Though this is not properly within our province as physical chemists, much recent material has been published within the last year upon the psychological and philosophical problems thereby posed.</span></p>

A period of even slight hesitation in adding the water reduces the negative time of solution, not infrequently wiping it out below the limits of detection. To avoid this, a mechanical device has been constructed, the essential design of which has already been reported in a previous communication.</span><span style="lang: en-US; vertical-align: superscript">6</span><span style="lang: en-US"> This device, termed the endochronometer, consists of a cell 2 cubic centimeters in size into which a desired weight of thiotimoline is placed, making certain that a small hollow extension at the bottom of the solution cell - 1 millimeter in internal diameter - is filled. To the cell is attached an automatic pressure micro-pipette containing a specific volume of the solvent concerned. Five seconds after the circuit is closed, this solvent is automatically delivered into the cell containing the thiotimoline. During the time of action, a ray of light is focused upon the small cell-extension described above, and at the instant of solution, the transmission of this light will no longer be impeded by the presence of solid thiotimoline. Both the instant of solution - at which time the transmission of light is recorded by a photoelectric device - and the instant of solvent addition can be determined with an accuracy of better than 0.01 %. If the first value is subtracted from the second, the time of solution (T) can be determined.</span></p>

It can be seen that, although in each case the volume at which this plateau is reached differs markedly with the concentration, the heights of the plateau are constant (i.e. -1.13). The volume at which it is reached, hereinafter termed the Plateau Volume (PV), decreases with decreasing concentration of sodium chloride, approaching the PV for water as the NaCl concentration approaches zero. It is, therefore, obvious that a sodium chloride solution of unknown concentration can be quite accurately characterized by the, determination of its PV, where other salts are absent.</span></p>

This holds also for those salts containing one singly charged ion and one double charged ion - i.e. sodium sulphate, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride - where the PV, though equal among the three, varies markedly from those of the first set. The PV is, therefore, apparently a function of the ionic strength of the solution.</span></p>

In the case of singly charged ions, such as in the first three salts listed in Table II, the PH is fairly close to that of water itself. It falls considerably where doubly charged ions, such as sulphate or calcium, are present. And when the triply charged phosphate ion or ferric ion is present, the value sinks to merely a quarter of its value in water.</span></p>

Thus, in Figure 4, we have the endochronic curve where a mixture of 0.001M Sodium Chloride and 0.001M Ferric Chloride solutions is the solvent.

But do such restrictions really represent an economic danger to Earth?

Your questions now are representative of a profound fallacy which is very common among our isolationists. In credit values, it is true that interstellar trade represents only five percent of our total trade, but ninety-five percent of our atomic engines are imported. Eighty percent of our thorium, sixty-five percent of our cesium, sixty percent of our molybdenum and tin are imported. The list can be extended almost indefinitely, and it is quite easy to see that the five percent is an extremely important, a vital, five percent. Furthermore, if a large manufacturer receives a shipment of atomic steel-shapers from Rhea, it does not follow that the benefit redounds only to him. Every man on Earth who uses steel implements or objects manufactured by steel implements benefits.</span></p>

That Earth's good food supply is tragically inadequate is true. The government would be the last to deny it. But our food exports do not represent any serious drain upon this supply. Less than one fifth of one percent of Earth's food is exported, and in return we obtain, for instance, fertilizers and farm machinery which more than make up for that small loss by increasing agricultural efficiency. Therefore, by buying less food from us, the Outer Worlds are engaged, in effect, in cutting our already inadequate food supply.</span></p>

I beg pardon, sir, but I was at the conference. At the time the note was issued, there was almost a stalemate among the Outer World delegates.

Earth's note ended that possibility instantly.</span></p>

However, I cannot answer the question directly, since I do not agree with your major premise. I cannot believe that the delegates of the Outer Worlds could behave in the manner you describe. In the first place, it is well known that the Outer Worlds are proud of their boast that the percentage of insanity, psychoses and even relatively minor maladjustments of personality are almost at the vanishing point in their society. It is one of their strongest arguments against Earth, that we have more psychiatrists than plumbers</span><span style="font-style: italic; lang: en-US"> </span><span style="lang: en-US">and yet are more pinched for want of the former. The delegates to the conference represented the best of this so-stable society. And now you would have me believe that these demigods would, in a moment of pique, have reversed their opinions and instituted a major change in the economic policy of fifty worlds. I cannot believe them capable of such childish and perverse activity, and must therefore insist that any action they took was based not upon any note from Earth, but upon motivations that go deeper.</span></p>

Nevertheless, we shall adhere to them, so that no planet may say that we have given the slightest pretext for hostilities. For instance, I am privileged to announce here for the first time that in the past month, five ships, traveling under false Earth registry, were stopped while being engaged in the smuggling of Outer World materiel into Earth. Their goods were confiscated and their personnel imprisoned. This is an earnest of our good intentions.</span></p>
