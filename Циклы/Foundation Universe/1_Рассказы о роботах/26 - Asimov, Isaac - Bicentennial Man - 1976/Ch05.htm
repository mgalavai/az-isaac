<br>             Such occasions' arose. Repairs were expensive, and revisions were even more so. With the years, new models of robots were produced and Sir saw to it that Andrew had the advantage of every new device, until he was a model of metallic excellence. It was all done at Andrew's expense. Andrew insisted on that.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Only his positronic pathways were untouched. Sir insisted on that.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new models aren't as good as you are, Andrew," he said. "The new robots are worthless. The company has learned to make the pathways more precise, more closely on the nose, more deeply on the track. The new robots don't shift. They do what they're designed for and never stray. I like you better."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Sir."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "And it's your doing, Andrew, don't you forget that. I am certain Mansky put an end to generalized pathways as soon as he had a good look at you. He didn't like the unpredictability. Do you know how many times he asked for you back so he could place you under study? Nine times! I never let him have you, though; and now that he's retired, we may have some peace."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So Sir's hair thinned and grayed and his face grew pouchy, while Andrew looked even better than he had when he first joined the family. Ma'am had joined an art colony somewhere in Europe, and Miss was a poet in New York. They wrote sometimes, but not often. Little Miss was married and lived not far away. She said she did not want to leave Andrew. When her child, Little Sir, was born, she let Andrew hold the bottle and feed him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With the birth of a grandson, Andrew felt that Sir finally had someone to replace those who had gone. Therefore, it would not be so unfair now to come to him with the request.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, it is kind of you to have allowed me to spend my money as I wished" ' "It was your money, Andrew." "Only by your voluntary act, Sir. I do not believe the  law would have stopped you from keeping it all." "The law won't persuade me to do wrong, Andrew." 3 "Despite all expenses, and despite taxes, too, Sir, I have nearly six hundred thousand dollars:"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that, Andrew."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to give it to you, Sir."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't take it, Andrew"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "In exchange for something you can give me, Sir"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh? What is that, Andrew?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "My freedom, Sir."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your-"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish to buy my freedom, Sir."
