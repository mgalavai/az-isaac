<br>             It was odd how that last deed caught the imagination of the world. All that Andrew had done before had not swayed them. But he had finally accepted even death to be human, and the sacrifice was too great to be rejected.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The final ceremony was timed, quite deliberately, for the two hundredth anniversary. The World President was to sign the act and make the people's will law. The ceremony would be visible on a global network and would be beamed to the Lunar state and even to the Martian colony.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew was in a wheelchair. He could still walk, but only shakily.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With mankind watching, the World President said, "Fifty years ago, you were declared The Sesquicentennial Robot, Andrew." After a pause, and in a more solemn tone, he continued, "Today we declare you The Bicentennial Man, Mr. Martin."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Andrew, smiling, held out his hand to shake that of the President.
