<br>             It wasn't that easy. Sir had flushed, had said, "For God's sake!" Then he had turned on his heel and stalked away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Little Miss who finally brought him round, defiantly and harshly-and in front of Andrew. For thirty years no one had ever hesitated to talk in front of Andrew, whether or not the matter involved Andrew. He was only a robot.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dad, why are you taking this as a personal affront? .He'll still be here. He'll still be loyal. He can't help, that; it's built in. All he wants is a form of words. Ha wants to be called free. Is that so terrible? Hasn't be earned this chance? Heavens, he and I have been talking about it for years!"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talking about it for years, have you?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, and over and over again he postponed it for fear he would hurt you. I made him put the matter up to you."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "He doesn't know what freedom is. He's a robot."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dad, you don't know him. He's read everything in the library. I don't know what he feels inside, but I don't know what you feel inside either. When you talk to him you'll find he reacts to the various abstractions as you and I do, and what else counts? If some one else's reactions are like your own, what more can you ask for?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "The law won't take that attitude," Sir said, angrily. "See here, you!" He turned to Andrew with a deliberate grate in his voice. "I can't free you except by doing it legally. If this gets into the courts, you not only won't get your freedom but the law will take official cognizance of your .money. They'll tell you that a robot has no right to earn money. Is this rigmarole worth losing your money?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Freedom is without price, Sir," said Andrew. "Even the chance of freedom is worth the money."
