<br>             Sir remained displeased, and his harsh voice made Andrew feel as if he were being short-circuited. "I don't want your damned money, Andrew. I'll take it only because you won't feel free otherwise. From now on, you can select your own jobs and do them as you please. I will give you no orders, except this one: Do as you please. But I am still responsible for you. That's part of the court order. I hope you understand that."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Miss interrupted. "Don't be irascible, Dad. The responsibility is no great chore. You know you won't have to do a thing. The Three Laws still hold."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how is he free?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are not human beings. bound by their laws, Sir?" Andrew replied.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not going to argue." Sir left the room, and Andrew saw him only infrequently after that.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Miss came to see him frequently in the small house that had been built and made over for him. It had. no kitchen, of course, nor bathroom facilities. It had just two rooms; one was a library and one was a combination storeroom and workroom. Andrew accepted many commissions and worked harder as a free robot than he ever had before, till the cost of the house was paid for and the structure was signed over to him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day Little Sir-no, "George!"-came. Little Sir had insisted on that after' the court decision. "A free robot doesn't call anyone Little Sir," George had said. "I call you Andrew. You must call me George."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His preference was phrased as an order, so Andrew called him George-but Little Miss remained Little Miss.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day when George came alone, it was to say that Sir was dying. Little Miss was at the bedside, but Sir wanted Andrew as well.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir's, voice was still quite strong, though he seemed unable to move much. He struggled to raise his hand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Andrew," he said, "Andrew-Don't help me, George. I'm only dying; I'm not crippled. Andrew, I'm glad you're free. I just wanted to tell you that."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew did not know what to say. He had never been at the side of someone dying before, but he knew it was the human way of ceasing to function. It was an involuntary and irreversible dismantling, and Andrew did not know what to say that might be appropriate. He could only remain standing, absolutely silent, absolutely motionless.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; When it was over, Little Miss said to him, "He may not have seemed friendly to you toward the end, Andrew, but he was old, you know; and it hurt him that you should want to be free."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Andrew found the words. "I would never have been free without him, Little Miss."
