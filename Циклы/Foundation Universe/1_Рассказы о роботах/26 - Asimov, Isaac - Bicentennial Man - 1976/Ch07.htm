<br>             It seemed the court might also take the attitude that freedom was without price, and might decide that for no price, however great, could a robot buy its freedom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The simple statement of the regional attorney who represented those who had brought a class action to oppose the freedom was this: "The word 'freedom' has no meaning when applied to a robot. Only a human being can be free." He said it several times, when it seemed appropriate; slowly, with his hand coming down rhythmically on the desk before him to mark the words.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Miss asked permission to speak on behalf of Andrew.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was recognized by her full name, something Andrew had never heard pronounced before: "Amanda Laura Martin Charney may approach the bench."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Your Honor. I am not a lawyer and I don't know the proper way of phrasing things, but I hope you will listen to my meaning and ignore the words.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's understand what it means to be free in Andrew's case. In some ways, he is free. I think it's at least twenty years since anyone in the Martin family gave him an order to do something that we felt he might not do of his own accord. But we can, if we wish, give him an order to do anything, couching it as harshly as we wish, because he is a machine that belongs to us. Why should we be in a position to do so, when he has served us so long, so faithfully, and has earned so much money for us? He owes us nothing more. The debit is entirely on the other side.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we were legally forbidden to place Andrew in involuntary servitude, he would still serve us voluntarily. Making him free would be a trick of words only, but it would mean much to him. It would give him everything and cost us nothing."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment the judge seemed to be suppressing a smile. "I see your point, Mrs. Chamey. The fact is that there is no binding law in this respect and no precedent. There is, however, the unspoken assumption that only a man may enjoy freedom. I can make new law here, subject to reversal in a higher court; but I cannot lightly run counter to that assumption. Let me address the robot. Andrew!"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Honor."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the first time Andrew bad spoken in court, and the judge seemed astonished for a moment at the human timbre of his voice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you want to be free, Andrew? In what way will this matter to you?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you wish to be a slave, Your Honor," Andrew asked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you are not a slave. You are a perfectly good robot-a genius of a robot, I am given. to understand, capable of an artistic expression that can be matched nowhere. What more could you do if you were free?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps no more than I do now, Your Honor, but with greater joy. It has been said in this courtroom that only a human being can be free. It seems to me that only someone who wishes for freedom can be free. I wish for freedom."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was that statement that cued the judge. The crucial sentence in his decision was "There is no right to deny freedom to any object with a mind advanced enough to grasp the concept and desire the state." It was eventually upheld by the World Court:
