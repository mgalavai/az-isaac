<br>             It was not a direct fight. Feingold and Martin counseled patience and Andrew muttered, grimly, that he.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an endless supply of that. Feingold and Martin then entered on a campaign to narrow and restrict the . area of combat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; They instituted a lawsuit denying the obligation to pay debts to an individual with a prosthetic heart on the grounds that the possession of a robotic organ removed humanity, and with it the constitutional rights of human beings. They fought the matter skillfully and tenaciously, losing at every step but always in such a way that the decision was forced to be as broad as possible, and then carrying it by way of appeals to the World Court.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It took years, and millions of dollars.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the final decision was handed down, DeLong held what amounted to a victory celebration over the legal loss. Andrew was, of course, present in the company offices on the occasion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "We've done two things, Andrew," said DeLong, "both of which are good. First of all, we have established the fact that no number of artificial parts in the human body causes it to cease being a human body. Secondly, we have engaged public opinion in the question in such a way as to put it fiercely on the side of a broad interpretation of humanity, since there is not a human being in existence who does not hope for prosthetics if they will keep him alive."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "And do you think the Legislature will now grant me my humanity?" Andrew asked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; DeLong looked faintly uncomfortable. "As to that, I cannot be optimistic. There remains the one organ which the World Court has used as the criterion of humanity. Human beings have an organic cellular brain and robots have a platinum iridium positronic brain if they have one at all-and you certainly have a positronic brain. No, Andrew, don't get that look in your eye. We lack the knowledge to duplicate the work of a cellular brain in artificial structures close enough to the organic type as to allow it to fall within the court's decision. Not even you could do it."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do, then?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Make the attempt, of course. Congresswoman Lihsing will be on our side and a growing number of other congress people. The President will undoubtedly go along with a majority of the Legislature in this matter."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we have a majority?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. Far from it. But we might get one if the public will allow its desire for a broad interpretation of humanity to extend to you. A small chance, I admit; but if you do not wish to give up, we must gamble for it."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not wish to give up."
