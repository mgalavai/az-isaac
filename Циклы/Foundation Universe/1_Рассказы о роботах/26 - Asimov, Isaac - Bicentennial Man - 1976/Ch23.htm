<br>             Andrew's thoughts were slowly fading as he lay in bed. Desperately he seized at them. Man! He was a man!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted that to be his last thought. He wanted to dissolve-die with that.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened his eyes one more time and for one last time recognized Li-hsing, waiting solemnly. Others were there, but they were only shadows, unrecognizable shadows. Only Li-hsing stood out against the deepening gray.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, inchingly, he held out his hand to her and very dimly and faintly felt her take it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was fading in his eyes as the last of his thoughts trickled away. But before she faded completely, one final fugitive thought came to him and rested for a moment on his mind before everything stopped.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Little Miss," he whispered, too low to be heard.
