<br>             Andrew's feeling of weakness was, he was sure, quite imaginary. He had recovered from the- operation. Nevertheless, he leaned, as unobtrusively as he could manage, against the wall. It would be entirely too revealing to sit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Li-hsing said, "The final vote will come this week, Andrew. I've been able to delay it no longer, and we must lose. And that will be it, Andrew:"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am grateful for your skill at delay. It gave me the time I needed, and I took the gamble I had to."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What gamble is this?" Li-hsing asked with open concern.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I couldn't tell you, or even the people at Feingold and Martin. I was sure I would be stopped. See here, if it is the brain that is at issue, isn't the greatest difference of all the matter of immortality. Who really cares what a brain looks like or is built of or how it was formed. What matters is that human brain cells die, must die. Even if every other organ in the body is maintained or replaced, the brain cells, which cannot be replaced without changing and therefore killing the personality, must eventually die.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "My own positronic pathways have lasted nearly two centuries without perceptible change, and can last for centuries more. Isn't that the fundamental barrier: human beings can tolerate an immortal robot, for it',' doesn't matter how long a machine lasts, but they cannot tolerate an immortal human being since their own mortality is endurable only so long as it is universal. And for that reason they won't make me a human being."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it you're leading up to, Andrew?" Li-hsing asked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have removed that problem. Decades ago, my positronic brain was connected to organic nerves. Now, one last operation has arranged that connection in such a way that slowly-quite slowly-the potential is being drained from my pathways."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Li-hsing's finely. wrinkled face showed no expression for a moment. Then her lips tightened. "Do you mean you've arranged to die, Andrew? You can't have. That violates the Third Law."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "No,", said Andrew, "I have chosen between the death of my body and the death of my aspirations and desires. To have let my body live at the cost of the greater death is what would have violated the Third Law."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Li-hsing seized his arm as though she were about to shake him. She stopped herself. "Andrew, it won't work! Change it back."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can't be done. Too much damage was done. I have a year to live more or less. I will last through the two-hundredth anniversary of my construction. I was weak enough to arrange that."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can it be worth it? Andrew, you're a fool."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it brings me humanity, that will be worth it. If it doesn't, it will bring an end to striving and that will be worth it, too."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Li-hsing did something that astonished herself. Quietly, she began to weep.
