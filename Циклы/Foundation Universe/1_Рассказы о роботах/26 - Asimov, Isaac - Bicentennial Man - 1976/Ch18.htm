<br>             The Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee was from the East Asian region and was a woman. Her name was Chee Li-hsing and her transparent garments-obscuring what she wanted obscured only by their dazzle-made her look plastic-wrapped.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I sympathize with your wish for full human rights," she said. "There have been times in history when segments of the human population fought for full human rights. What rights, however, can you possibly want that you do not have?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "As simple a thing as my right to life," Andrew stated. "A robot can be dismantled at any time."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "A human being can be executed at any time."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Execution can only follow due process of law. There is no trial needed for my dismantling. Only the word of a human being in authority is needed to end me. Besides ... besides ..." Andrew tried desperately to allow no sign of pleading, but his carefully designed tricks of human expression and tone of voice betrayed him here. "The truth is I want to be a man. I have wanted it through six generations of human beings."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Li-hsing looked up at him out of darkly sympathetic eyes. "The Legislature can pass a law declaring you one. They could pass a law declaring that a stone statue be defined as a man. Whether they will actually do so is, however, as likely in the first case as the second. Congress people are as human as the rest of the population and there is always that element of suspicion against robots."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even now?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even now. We would all allow the fact that you have earned the prize of humanity, and yet there would remain the fear of setting an undesirable precedent."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What precedent? I am the only free robot, the only one of my type, and there will never be another. You may consult U.S. Robots."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Never' is a long word, Andrew-or, if you prefer, Mr. Martin-since I will gladly give you my personal accolade as man. You will find that most congress people will not be so willing to set the precedent, no matter how meaningless such a precedent might be. Mr. Martin, you have my sympathy, but I cannot tell you to hope. Indeed ..."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She sat back and her forehead wrinkled. "Indeed, if the issue grows too heated, there might well arise a certain sentiment, both inside the Legislature and outside, for that dismantling you mentioned. Doing away, with you could turn out to be the easiest way of resolving the dilemma. Consider that before deciding to push matters."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew stood firm. "Will no one remember the technique of prosthetology, something that is almost entirely mine?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may seem cruel, but they won't. Or if they do, it will be remembered against you. People will say you did it only for yourself. It will be said it was part of a campaign to roboticize human beings, or to humanify robots; and in either case evil and vicious. You have never been part of a political hate campaign, Mr. Martin; but I tell you that you would be the object of vilification of a kind neither you nor I would credit, and there would be people to believe it all. Mr. Martin, let your life be."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She rose, and next to Andrew's seated figure she seemed small and almost childlike.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I decide to fight for my humanity, will you be on my side?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought, then replied, "I will be-insofar as I can be. If at any time such a stand would appear to threaten my political future, I might have to abandon you, since it is not an issue I feel to be at the very root of my beliefs. I am trying to be honest with you."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, and I will ask no more. I intend to fight this through, whatever the consequences, and I will ask you for your help only for as long as you can give it."
