<br>             Gerald Martin took Andrew to the regional offices of  the United States Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation. As a member of the Regional Legislature he y had no trouble at all in gaining an interview with the chief robopsychologist. In fact, it was only as a member of the Regional Legislature that he qualified as a 7 robot owner in the first place-in those early days when robots were rare.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew did not understand any of this at the time. But in later years, with greater learning, he could review that early scene and understand it in its proper light.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The robopsychologist, Merton Mansky, listened with a growing frown and more than once managed to stop his fingers at the point beyond which they would have irrevocably drummed on the table. He had drawn features and a lined forehead, but he might actually have been younger than he looked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Robotics is not an exact art, Mr. Martin," Mansky . explained. "I cannot explain it to you in detail, but the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways is far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions. Naturally, since we build everything around the Three Laws, those are incontrovertible. We will, of course, replace your robot—"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all," said Sir. "There is no question of failure , on his part. He performs his assigned duties perfectly. The point is he also carves wood in exquisite fashion and never the same twice. He produces works of art.", 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mansky looked confused. "Strange. Of course, we're attempting generalized pathways these days. Really creative, you think?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "See for yourself." Sir handed over a little sphere of wood on which there was a playground scene in which the boys and girls were almost too small to make out, yet they were in perfect proportion and they blended so naturally with the grain that it, too, seemed to have been carved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mansky was incredulous. "He did that?" He handed it back with a shake of his head. "The luck of the draw. Something in the pathways."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you do it again?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably not. Nothing like this has ever been reported."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! I don't in the least mind Andrew's being the only one."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that the company would like to have your robot back for study," Mansky said.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not a chance!" Sir said with sudden grimness. "Forget it." He turned to Andrew, "Let's go home, now."
