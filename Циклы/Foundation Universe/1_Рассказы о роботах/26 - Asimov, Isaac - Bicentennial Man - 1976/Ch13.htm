<br>             The meeting was not easy to arrange, even with Paul's supposedly weighted name. But it finally came about. When it did, Harley Smythe-Robertson, who, on his mother's side, was descended from the original founder of the corporation and who had adopted the hyphenation to indicate it, looked remarkably unhappy. He was approaching retirement age and his entire tenure as president had been devoted to the matter of robot rights. His gray hair was plastered thinly over the top of his scalp; his face was not made up, and he eyed Andrew with brief hostility from time to time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew began the conversation. "Sir, nearly a century ago, I was told by a Merton Manskyk of this corporation that the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways was far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions and that, therefore, my own capacities were not fully predictable."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was a century ago." Smythe-Robertson hesitated, then said icily, "Sir. It is true no longer. Our robots are made with precision now and are trained precisely to their jobs."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Paul, who had come along, as he said, to make sure that the corporation played fair, "with the result that my receptionist must be guided at every point once events depart from the conventional, however slightly."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "You would be much more displeased if it were to improvise," Smythe-Robertson said.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you no longer manufacture robots like myself which are flexible and adaptable."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "No longer."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "The research I have done in connection with my book," said Andrew, "indicates that I am the oldest robot presently in active operation."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "The oldest presently," said Smythe-Robertson, "and the oldest ever. The oldest that will ever be. No robot is useful after the twenty-fifth year. They are called in and replaced with newer models."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "No robot as presently manufactured is useful after the twentieth year," said Paul, with a note of sarcasm creeping into his voice. "Andrew is quite exceptional in this respect."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew, adhering to the path he had marked out for himself, continued, "As the oldest robot in the world and the most flexible, am I not unusual enough to merit special treatment from the company?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all," Smythe-Robertson said, freezing up. "Your unusualness is an embarrassment to the company. If you were on lease, instead of having been an outright sale through some mischance, you would long since have been replaced."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that is exactly the point," said Andrew. "I am .. a free robot and I own myself. Therefore I come to you and ask you to replace me. You cannot do this without the owner's consent. Nowadays, that consent is extorted as a condition of the lease, but in my time this did not happen."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Smythe-Robertson was looking both startled and puzzled, and for a moment there was silence. Andrew found himself staring at the hologram on the wall. It was a death mask of Susan Calvin, patron saint of all roboticists. She had been dead for nearly two centuries now, but as a result of writing his book Andrew knew, her so well he could half persuade himself that he had met her in life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Smythe-Robertson asked, "How can I replace you for you? If I replace you, as robot, how can I donate the new robot to you as owner since in the very act of replacement you cease to exist" He smiled fryly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all difficult," Paul interposed. "The seat of Andrew's personality is his positronic brain and it is the one part that cannot be replaced without creating a new robot. The positronic brain, therefore, is Andrew the owner. Every other part of the robotic body can be replaced without affecting the robot's personality, and those other parts are the brain's possessions. Andrew, I should say, wants to supply his brain with a new robotic body."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right," said Andrew, calmly. He turned to Smythe=Robertson. "You have manufactured androids, haven't you? Robots that have the outward appearance of humans, complete to the texture of the skin?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we have. They worked perfectly well, with their synthetic fibrous skins and tendons.. There was virtually no metal anywhere except for the brain, yet they were nearly as tough as metal robots. They were tougher, weight for weight."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul looked interested. "I didn't know that. How many are on the market?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "None," said Smythe-Robertson. "They were much more expensive than metal models and a market survey showed they would not be accepted. They looked too human."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew was impressed. "But the corporation retains its expertise, I assume. Since it does, I wish to request that I be replaced by an organic robot, an android."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul looked surprised. "Good Lord!" he said.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Smythe-Robertson stiffened. "Quite impossible!"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is it impossible?" Andrew asked. "I will pay any reasonable fee, of course."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "We do not manufacture androids."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "You do not choose to manufacture androids," Paul interjected quickly. "That is not the same as being unable to manufacture them."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nevertheless," Smythe-Robertson responded, "the manufacture of androids is against public policy."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no law against it," said Paul.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nevertheless, we do not manufacture them—and we will not"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul cleared his throat. "Mr. Smythe-Robertson," he said, "Andrew is a free robot who comes under the purview of the law guaranteeing robot rights. You are aware of this, I take it?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only too well."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "This robot, as a free robot, chooses to wear clothes This results in his being frequently humiliated by thoughtless human beings despite the law against the humiliation of robots. It is difficult to prosecute vague offenses that don't meet with the general disapproval of those who must decide on guilt and innocence."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "U.S. Robots understood that from the start. Your father's firm unfortunately did not."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father is dead now, but what I see is that we have here a clear offense with a clear target."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about?" said Smythe-Robertson.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "My client, Andrew Martin he has just become my client is a free robot who is entitled to ask U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation for the rights of replacement, which the corporation supplies to anyone who owns a robot for more than twenty-five years. In fact, the corporation insists on such replacement."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul was smiling and thoroughly at ease. "The positronic brain of my client," he went on, "is the owner of the body of my client which is certainly more than twenty-five years old. The positronic brain demands the replacement of the body and offers to pay any reason able fee for an android body as that replacement. If you refuse the request, my client undergoes humiliation and we will sue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "While public opinion would not ordinarily support the claim of a robot in such a case, may I remind you that U.S. Robots is not popular with the public generally. Even those who most use and profit from robots are suspicious of the corporation. This may be a hangover from the days when robots were widely feared.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be resentment against the power and wealth of U.S. Robots, which has a worldwide monopoly. Whatever the cause may be, the resentment eats. I think you will find that you would prefer not to be faced with a lawsuit, particularly since my client is wealthy and will live for many more centuries and will have no reason to refrain from fighting the battle forever."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Smythe-Robertson had slowly reddened. "You are trying to force-"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I force you to do nothing," said Paul. "If you wish to refuse to accede to my client's reasonable request, you may by all means do so and we will leave without another word. But we will sue, as is certainly our right, and you will find that you will eventually lose."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well. "
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see that you are going to accede," said Paul. "You may hesitate but you will come to it in the end. Let me assure you, then, of one further point: If, in the process of transferring my client's positronic brain from his present body to an organic one, there is any damage, however slight, then I will never rest until I've nailed the corporation to the ground. I will, if necessary, take every possible step to mobilize public opinion against the corporation if one brain path of my client's platinum-iridium essence is scrambled." He turned to Andrew and asked, "Do you agree to all this, Andrew?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew hesitated a full minute. It amounted to the approval of lying, of blackmail, of the badgering and humiliation of a human being. But not physical harm, he told himself, not physical harm.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He managed at last to come out with a rather faint "Yes."
