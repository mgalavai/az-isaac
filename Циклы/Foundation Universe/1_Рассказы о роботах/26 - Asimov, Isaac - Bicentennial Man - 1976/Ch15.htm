<br>             It took time, but Andrew had time. In the first place, he did not wish to do anything till Paul-had died in peace. With the death of the great-grandson of Sir, Andrew felt more nearly exposed to a hostile world and for that reason was all the more determined along the path he had chosen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he was not really alone. If a man had died, the firm of Feingold and Martin lived, for a corporation does not die any more than a robot does.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The firm had its directions and it followed them soullessly. By way of the trust and through the law firm, Andrew continued to be wealthy. In return for their own large annual retainer, Feingold and Martin involved themselves in the legal aspects of the new combustion chamber. But when the time came for Andrew to visit U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation, he did it alone. Once he had gone with Sir and once with Paul. This time, the third time, he was alone and manlike.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. Robots had changed. The actual production plant had been shifted to a large space station, as had grown to be the case with more and more industries. With them had gone many robots. The Earth itself was becoming park like, with its one-billion-person population stabilized and perhaps not more than thirty percent of its at-least-equally-large robot population independently brained.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Director of Research was Alvin Magdescu, dark of complexion and hair, with a little pointed beard and wearing nothing above the waist but the breast band that fashion dictated. Andrew himself was well covered in the older fashion of several decades back.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Magdescu offered his hand to his visitor. "I know you, of course, and I'm rather pleased to see you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; You're our most notorious product and it's a pity old Smyth Robertson was so set against you. We could have done a great deal with you."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still can," said Andrew.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't think so. We're past the time. We've had robots on Earth for over a century, but that's changing. It will be back to space with them, and those that stay here won't be brained."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there remains myself, and I stay on Earth."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "True, but there doesn't seem to be much of the robot about you. What new request have you?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be still less a robot. Since I am so far organic, I wish an organic source of energy. I have here the plans . . : '
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Magdescu did not hasten through them. He might have intended to at first, but he stiffened and grew intent. At one point, he said, "This is remarkably ingenious. Who thought of all this?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did," Andrew replied.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Magdescu looked up at him sharply, then said, "It would amount to a major overhaul of your body, and an experimental one, since such a thing has never been attempted before. I advise against it. Remain as you are."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew's face had limited means of expression, but impatience showed plainly in his voice. "Dr. Magdescu, you miss the entire point: You have no choice but to accede to my request. If such devices can be built into my body, they can be built into human bodies as well. The tendency to lengthen human life by prosthetic devices has already been remarked on. There are no devices better than the ones I have designed or am designing. It happens, I control the patents by way of the firm of Feingold and Martin. We are quite capable of going into business for ourselves and of developing the kind of prosthetic devices that may end by producing human beings with many of the properties of robots. Your own business will then suffer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "If, however, you operate on me now and agree to do so under similar circumstances in the future, you will receive permission to make use of the patents and control the technology of both robots and of the prosthetization of human beings. The initial leasing will not be granted, of course, until after the first operation is completed successfully, and after enough time has passed to demonstrate that it is indeed successful."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew felt scarcely any First Law inhibition to the stern conditions he was setting a human being. He was learning to reason that what seemed like cruelty might, in the long run, be kindness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Magdescu was stunned. "I'm not the one to decide something like this. That's a corporate decision that would take time."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can wait a reasonable time," said Andrew, "but only a reasonable time." And he thought with satisfaction that Paul himself could not have done it better.
