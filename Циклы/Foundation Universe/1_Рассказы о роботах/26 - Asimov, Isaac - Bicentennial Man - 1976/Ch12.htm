<br>             Andrew waited patiently when the receptionist-robot disappeared into the inner office. The receptionist might have used the holographic chatterbox, but unquestionably it was perturbed by having to deal with another robot rather than with a human being.,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew passed the time revolving the matter in his mind: Could "unroboted" be used as an analog of "unmanned," or had unmanned become a metaphoric term sufficiently divorced from its original literal meaning to be applied to robots—or to women for that matter? Such problems frequently arose as he worked on his book on robots. The trick of thinking out sentences to express all complexities had undoubtedly increased his vocabulary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, someone came into the room to stare at him and he did not try to avoid the glance. He looked at each calmly, and each in turn looked away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Martin finally emerged. He looked surprised, or he would have if Andrew could have made out his expression with certainty. Paul had taken to wearing the heavy makeup that fashion was dictating for bath sexes. Though it made sharper and firmer the somewhat bland lines of. Paul's face, Andrew disapproved. He found that disapproving of human beings, as long, as he did not express it verbally, did not make him very uneasy. He could even write the disapproval. He was sure it had not always been so.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, Andrew. I'm sorry I made you wait, but there was something I had to finish. Come in, you had said you wanted to talk to me, but I didn't know you meant here in town."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are busy, Paul, I am prepared to continue to wait."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul glanced at the interplay of shifting shadows on the dial on the wall that served as timepieces and said, "I can make some time. Did you come alone?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hired an automatobile."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Any trouble?" Paul asked, with more than a trace of anxiety.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wasn't expecting any. My rights are protected."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul looked all the more anxious for that. "Andrew, I've explained that the law is unenforceable, at least under most conditions. And if you insist on wearing clothes, you'll run into trouble eventually; just like that first time."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "And only time, Paul. I'm sorry you are displeased"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, look at it this way: you are virtually a living legend, Andrew, and you are too valuable in many different ways for you to have any right to take chances with yourself. By the way, how's the book coming?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am approaching the end, Paul. The publisher is quite pleased."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know that he's necessarily pleased with the book as a book. I think he expects to sell many copies because it's written by a robot and that's what pleases him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only human, I'm afraid."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not displeased. Let it sell for whatever reason, since it will mean money and I can use some."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandmother left you-"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Little Miss was generous, and I'm sure I can count on the family to help me out further. But it is the royalties from the book on which I am counting to help me through the next step."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What next step is that?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish to see the head of U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation. I have tried to make an appointment; but so far I have not been able to reach him. The Corporation did not cooperate with me in the writing of the book, so I am not surprised, you understand."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul was clearly amused. "Cooperation is the last thing you can expect. They didn't cooperate with us, in our great fight for robot rights. Quite the reverse, and you can see why. Give a robot rights and people may not want to buy them."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nevertheless," said Andrew, "if you call them, you may be able to obtain an interview for me."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm no more popular with them than you are, Andrew."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But perhaps you can hint that by seeing me they may head off a campaign by Feingold and Martin to strengthen the rights of robots further."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wouldn't that be a lie, Andrew?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Paul, and I can't tell one. That is why you must call."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you can't lie, but you can urge me to tell a lie, is that it? You're getting more human all the time, Andrew."
