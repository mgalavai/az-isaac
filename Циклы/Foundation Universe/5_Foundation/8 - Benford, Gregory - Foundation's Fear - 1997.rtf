\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 R. Daneel Olivaw did not look like Eto Demerzel. That role he had already cast aside.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 This Dors Vanabili expected, though it was unsettling to her. She knew that through millennia he had discarded the skin and shape of countless guises.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
Dors studied him in the cramped, dingy room two Sectors away from Streeling University. She had followed a convoluted route to get here and the site was protected by elaborate, overlapping security measures. Robots were outlaws. They had lived for millenn
ia in the deep shadow of taboo. Though Olivaw was her guide and mentor, she saw him seldom.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Yet as a humaniform robot she felt a tremor of mingled fear and reverence at this ancient, partly metallic form before her. He was nearly twenty millennia old. Thoug
h he could appear human, he did not truly wish to be human. He was inexpressibly greater than that now.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 She had lived happily as a pseudo-person for so long now. Even a reminder of who and what she was came like cold fingers along her spine. "The recent increasing attention paid to Hari... "}{
\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Olivaw reached out and touched her hand. She blinked back tears and studied his face. Small matters, such as consistent movement of his Adam's apple when he swallowed, had long ago been per
fected. To ease himself in this meeting, he had omitted these minor computations and movements. He obviously enjoyed even momentary freedom from such taxation.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Olivaw shook his head slowly. "I doubt that. He is a certain special kind of human\emdash driven. He once remarked to me, 'Genius does what it must and talent does what it can'\emdash 
thinking that he merely had talent."}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

His father had also told him that in a public trade of barbs, the one who lost temper first lost the exchange. He had not recalled that until this instant. Hari remembered too late that Lamurk was known for his humor in High Council meetings. Probably scr

those that had devolved in isolation, reverting to cruder ways of life. He knew this pyramid-shaped order to be among the most natural and enduring human social patterns. Even when a planet was reduced to simple agri

Voltaire endured Joan's introduction with what he hoped was a stoic smile. He elaborately insisted that Joan make her points first, only to have the moderator rather rudely tell him that here, they flipped a coin.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Voltaire won. He shrugged, then placed his hand over his heart. He began his recital in the declamatory style so dear to eighteenth-century Parisian hearts: no matter how defined th

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 And yet, Voltaire continued to pontificate, there was nothing more obvious in Nature than the work of an intelligence greater than man's\emdash 
which man is able, within limits, to decipher. That man can decode Nature's secrets proved what the Church fathers and all the founders of the world's great religions had always said: that man's 
intelligence is a reflection of that same Divine Intelligence which authored Nature. Were this not so, natural philosophers could not}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

ld not discern them. The very harmony between natural law, and our ability to discover it, strongly suggested that sages and priests of all persuasions are essentially correct!\emdash 
in arguing that we are but the creatures of an Almighty Power, whose Power is reflected in us. And this reflection in us of that Power may be justly termed our universal, immortal, yet individual souls.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

are somehow accidental. Chance is one of the principles through which natural law works. That principle may correspond with the t
raditional religious view that man is free to chart his own course. But this freedom, even when apparently random, obeys statistical laws in a way that man can comprehend. "}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

In darkness he was lying across support struts directly over a soothing booth. He could see down through a narrow slit. From below, he hoped, the slit was the only sign that the ceiling had been pushed up, a square dislocated. He

in the darkness and thought. Dors' palace map popped up in his eye on command, its colors and details more vivid in the gloom. Of course it showed nothing as utilitarian as this crawl space. He could see he was deeply embedded in the Lyceum's fringe areas

bearings and peered in that direction. He had no idea how an e-lift fit into a building. The map simply showed a rectangular enclosure with a lift symbol. But a burning fear made his muscles clench and fret.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 He started crawling that way, not because he kne
w what to do, but because he didn't. Upright cerami-form studs provided support and he had to be careful to not knock ceiling tiles out of their mounts. He slipped and jammed a knee into one and it gave threateningly, then popped back up. Dim threads of p
hosphor glow seeped between the tiles. Dust tickled his nostrils and coated his lips. He was getting dirty with the grime of millennia.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 The 
blue radiance leaked around the edges of a panel. Suddenly it flared, then died again as he edged closer. A sharp crackling told him that an e-cell had just passed in the lift. He could not tell whether it was going up or down.}{
\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 The panel was ceramo-steel, 
about a meter on a side, with electrical ribbons attached at all four sides. He did not know in detail how an e-lift worked, only that it charged the carrier compartment and then handed the weight off among a steady wave of elec-trodynamic fields.}{
\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

small passenger lifts like this one, over heights of a kilometer. Charge coupling from the shaft walls to the e-cell handled the dynamics with ease. The technology was aged and reliable. This shaft must be at least ten millennia old, and smelled like it.}

rous. Easier, certainly, to climb down\emdash but also farther.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 It would not be that tricky, he reassured himself. In the shadowy shaft he saw regular electrostatic emitters}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 sunken into the walls. He found a strand of electrical ribbon and poked into one. No spark

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Shouting from above. Several voices, male. Probably someone had seen the scrapes on top of the soothing booth. The light from the open ceiling tile was some help now, sending pale radiance into the shaft.}{
\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

To his right he saw another regularly spaced emitter hole. He got his foot into it and worked his way around to the next face of the shaft. He started climbing. It was surprisingly easy because the holes were closely spaced and about the right size for hi

... the destruction of all earlier records during the expansion of humanity through the Galaxy, with the attendant eras of warfare, leaves in shadow the entire problem of human origins. The enormous changes wrou
ght on so many worlds also erased any evidence for much older, alien civilizations. These societies may have existed, though there is no firm evidence for them. Some early historians believed that at least one type of remnant might have survived in the Ga
l
axy: the electromagnetic records. These would have to be lodged in plasma streams or the coronal loops of stars, and thus lie beyond the detection of Expansionist technology. Even modern studies have found no such sentient structures. However, the virulen
t radiation levels at the Galactic core\emdash where energy densities might promise an hospitable abode for magnetically based forms\emdash 
make such investigations difficult and ambiguous. Another theory holds that cultures might have "written" themselves into pre-Empir
e computer codes, and thus now reside undetected in some banks of ancient data. Such speculations met with no proof and were discounted. Thus the entire problem of why the Galaxy was empty of advanced life when humanity ventured into it has no resolution.

imov estate's representative, Ralph Vicinanza. Approached by them, I at first declined, being busy with physics and my own novels. But my subconscious, once aroused, refused to let go the notion. After half a year of struggling with ideas plainly made for
 
the Foundation, persistently demanding expression, I finally called up Ralph Vicinanza and began putting together a plan to construct a fittingly complex curve of action and meaning, to be revealed in several novels. Though we spoke to several authors abo
ut this project, the best suited seemed two hard SF writers broadly influenced by Asimov and of unchallenged technical ability: Greg Bear and David Brin.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

are preliminary titles. ) I have planted in the narrative prefiguring details and key elements which shall bear later fruit.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

rs as well. This isn't a defect; it's the essential nature of popular culture, which the United States has dominated in our age, with the invention of jazz, rock, the musical, and written genres such as the Western, the hardboiled detective, modern fantas

Isaac himself revisited the Foundation, taking different angles of attack each time. In the beginning, psychohistory equated the movements of people as a whole with the motions of molecules. The Second Foundation looked at perturbations to such d
eterministic laws (the Mule) and implied that only a superhuman elite could manage instabilities. Later, robots emerged as the elite, better than humans at dispassionate government. Beyond robots came Gaia... and so on.}{

Of course, we know some incidental answers. The term "psychohistory" was commonly used in the thirties and appears in the 1934 Webster's Dictionary; Isaac greatly extended its meaning, though. He didn't want to deal with John W. Campbell's not
orious dislike of aliens who might be as clever as we, so his Foundation had none. But it seemed to me there might be more to the matter.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

the Foundation series became intricate and puzzling. The British critic Brian Stableford found this "comforting in its claustrophobic enclosure. " There are no robots in the early Foundation novels, but they are behind-the-scenes manipulators in both Prel

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Asimov wrote each novel at the level of the then current scientific understanding. Later works updated the surrounding science. Thus his galaxy is more detailed in 
later books, including in Foundation's Edge both advanced computers and a black hole at the Galactic Center. Similarly, here I have depicted our more detailed knowledge of the Galactic Center, hi place of Isaac's "hyperspace" ships I have used worm-holes,
 
which have considerably more theoretical justification now than they did when Einstein and Rosen introduced them in the 1930s. Indeed, wormholes are allowed by the general theory of relativity, but must have extreme forms of matter to form and support the
m. (Matt Visser's Lorentzian Wormholes is the standard work on current thinking. )}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Isaac wrote much of his fiction in a style he termed "direct and spare, " though in the later works he relaxed this constraint a bit. I have not attempted to write in the Asi
mov style. (Those who think it is easy to write clearly about complex subjects should try it. ) For the Foundation novels he used a particularly bare-boards approach, with virtually no background descriptions or novelistic details.}{

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Note his own reaction when he decided to return to the series and revisited the trilogy:}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 "I read it with mounting uneasiness. I kept waiting for something to happen, and nothing ever did. All three volumes, all the nearly quarter of a million words, consisted of thoughts and conv
ersation. No action. No physical suspense. "}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 But it worked, famously so. I could not manage such an approach, so have taken my own way.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 I found that the details of Trantor, of psychohistory and the Empire, called out to me as I began thinking about this novel\emdash 
indeed, they led me on my subconscious quest of the underlying story. So the book is not an imitation Asimov novel but a Benford novel using Asimov's basic ideas and backdrop.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 
\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 Necessarily my approach has harkened back to the older storytelling styles which prevailed in the SF of Isaac's days. I have never responded favorably to the recent razoring of literature by crirics\emdash

 crucial coin of SF, imagination. Some deconstructionists have attacked science i

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 At the core of SF lies the exp

en merely leads to literature seen as empty word games.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

verboard in depicting the view that science does not deal with objective truths, but instead is a battleground of power politics where "naive realism" meets relativist worldviews, should look into The Golem by Harry Collins and Trevor Pinch. This book att

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 From Verne and Wells to somewhere near 1970, science fiction was mostly about the wonders of m

\par }{\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033 As James Gunn noted, the Foundation series is a saga. Its method lies in a repeated pattern: Out of the solution of each problem grows the next problem to be solved. This became, of course, a considerable c
onstraint on later novels. Asimov seemed to be saying that life was a series of problems to be solved, but life itself could never be solved. As Gunn remarked, considering that the combined and integrated Foundation and Robot saga now covers sixteen books
, perhaps a directory of it all is called for, named, perhaps, Encyclopedia Galactica?}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033

orty billion, but in Second Foundation it is 400 billion (unless that's a typo). Spread forty billion over an Earth-sized world (with all its seas drained), and that's only about a hundred per square kilometer. Surely housing them would not demand a half-
kilometer-deep city.}{\f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\langnp1033
