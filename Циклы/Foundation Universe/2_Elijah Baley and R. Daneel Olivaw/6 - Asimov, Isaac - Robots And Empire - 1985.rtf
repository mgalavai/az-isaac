The rain forest had, indeed, been lush and green, with the trees carefully planted in rank and file and the animal life thoughtfully selected so as to provide color and delight, wh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

It didn't make them unusual to avoid trips. Aurorans generally-Spacers generally, for that matter-tended to be stay-at-homes. Their worlds, their establishments, were too comfortable. After all, what pleasure could be greater than that of being taken care
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 of by your own robots, robots who knew your every signal, and, for that matter, knew your ways and desires even without being told.}{\fs20\loch\af13\hich\af0
