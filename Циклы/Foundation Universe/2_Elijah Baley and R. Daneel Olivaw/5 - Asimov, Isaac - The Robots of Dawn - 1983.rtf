\par He stood beneath the leafy canopy of the tree (a kind of primitive wall and ceiling, with the solidity of the bark comfort\-ing to the touch) and looked again at the group, studying it. Once a week they were out there, whatever the weather.

\par Baley recognized it for what it was and muttered to Ben, \'93I may have to go. Jehoshaphat!\'94
\par What was troubling the robot was what the roboticists called an equipotential of contradiction on the secQnd level. Obedience was the Second Law and R. Ceronimo was now suffering from }{\fs20 two roughly equal }{\fs20 
and contradictory orders. Robot-block was }{\fs20 what the general population called it or, more frequently, }{\fs20 roblock for short.
\par Slowly, the robot turned. Its original order was the stronger, but not by much, so that its voice was slurred. \'93Master, I was told you might say }{\fs20 that. If so I was to say\emdash \'94 }{\fs20 It paused, then added hoarsely, }{\fs20 \'93

\par For a moment, Baley played irritably with the notion of strengthening his own }{\fs20 order }{\fs20 and making the roblock more nearly complete, but that would surely cause the kind of dam\-
age that would require positronic analysis and reprogramming. The expense of that would be taken out of his salary and }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 might easily amount to a year\rquote s pay.

It took half an hour for Baley to reach the entranceway into the City and he stiffened himself for what he suspected ahead. Perhaps\emdash perhaps\emdash it wouldn\rquote t happen this time.
\par He reached the dividing plane between Outside and City, the wall that marked off chaos from civilization. He placed his hand over the signal patch and an opening appeared. As usual, he didn\rquote 
t wait for the opening to be completed, but slipped in as soon as it was wide enough. R. Geronimo followed.
\par The police sentry on duty looked startled, as he always did when someone came in from Outside. Each time there was the same look of disbelief, the same coming to attention, the same sudden hand upon the blaster, the same frown of uncertainty.
\par Baley presented his identity card with a scowl and the sentry saluted. The door closed behind him\emdash and it happened.
\par Baley was inside the City. The walls closed around him and the City became the Universe. He was again immersed in the endless, eternal hum and odor of people and machin
ery that would soon fade below the threshold of consciousness; in the soft, indirect artificial light that was nothing at all like the par\-
tial and varying glare of the Outside, with its green and brown and blue and white and its interruptions of red and yellow. Here there was no erratic wind, no heat, no cold, no threat of rain; here there was instead the quiet permanence of unfelt air cur
\-rents that kept everything fresh. Here was a designed combina\-tion of temperature and humidity so perfectly adjusted to hu\-mans it remained unsensed.
\par Baley felt his breath drawn in tremulously and he gladdened

 womb and moved back into it with glad relief. He knew that such a womb was something from which humanity must emerge and be born. Why did he always sink back this way?
\par And would that always be? Would it really be that, though he might lead countless numbers out of the City and off the Earth and out to the stars, he would not, in the end, be able to go himself? Would he always feel at home only in the City?
\par He clenched his teeth\emdash but there was no use thinking about it.
\par He said to the robot, \'93Were you brought to this point by car, boy?\'94
\par \'93Yes, master.\'94
\par \'93Where is it now?\'94
\par \'93I do not know, master.\'94
\par Baley turned to the sentry. \'93Officer, this robot was brought to this spot two hours ago. What has happened to the car that brought him?\'94
\par \'93Sir, I went on duty less than an hour ago.\'94
\par Actually, it was foolish to ask. Those in the car did not know how long it would take the robot to find him, so they would not wait. Baley had a brief impulse to call in, but they would tell him to take the Expressway; it would be quicker.
\par The only reason he hesitated was the presence of R. Geron\-imo. He didn\rquote t want its company on the Expressway and yet he could not expect the robot to make its way back to Head\-quarters through hostile crowds.
\par Not that he had a choice. Undoubtedly, the Commissioner was not eager to make this easy for him. He would be annoyed at not having had him on call, free time or not.
\par Baley said, \'93This way, boy.\'94
\par The City covered over five thousand square kilometers and contained over four hundred kilometers of Expressway,
 plus hundreds of kilometers of Feederway, to serve its well over twenty million people. The intricate net of movement existed on eight levels and there were hundreds of interchanges of varying degrees of complexity.

\fs20 As a plainclothesman, Baley was\rquote  expected to know them all\emdash  and he did. Put him down blindfolded in any corner of the City, whip off the blindfold, and he could make his way flawlessly to any other designated portion.
\par There was no question then but that he knew how to get to Headquarters. There were eight reasonable routes he could fol\-low, however, and for a moment he hesitated over which might be least crowded at this time.
\par Only for a moment. Then he decided and said, \'93Come with me, boy.\'94 The robot followed docilely at his heels.
\par They swung onto a passing Feeder and Baley seized one of the vertical poles: white, warm, and textured to give a good grip. Baley did not want to sit down; they would not be on for long. The robot had waited for Baley\rquote 
s quick gesture before placing its hand upon the same pole. It might as well have remained standing without a grip\emdash it would not have been difficult to maintain balance\emdash but Baley wanted to take no chance of being separated. He was 
responsible for the robot and did not wish to risk being asked to replace the financial loss to the City should anything happen to B. Geronimo.
\par The Feeder had a few other people on board and the eyes of each turned curiously\emdash and inevitably\emdash to the robot. One by one, Baley caught those glances. Baley had the look of one used to authority and the eyes he caught turned uneasily away.

\par Baley gestured again as he swung off the Feeder. It had reached the strips now and was moving at the same speed as the nearest st
rip, so that there was no necessity for it to slow down. Baley stepped onto that nearest strip and felt the whipping of air once they were no longer protected by plastic enclosure.
\par He leaned into the wind with the ease of long practice, lifting one arm to break the force at eye level. He ran the strips down\-ward to the intersection with the Expressway and then began the run upward to the speed-strip that bordered the Expressway.

\par He heard the teenage cry of \'93Robot!\'94 (he had been a teenager himself once) and knew exactly what would happen. A group of them\emdash two or three or half a dozen\emdash 
would swarm up or down the strips and somehow the robot would be tripped and would go clanging down. Then, if it ever came before a magistrate, any teenager taken into custody would claim the robot had collided

\par Baley moved rapidly and was between the first of the teen\-
agers and the robot. He sidestepped onto a faster strip, brought his arm higher, as though to adjust to the increase in wind speed, and somehow the young man was nudged off course and onto a slower strip for which he was not prepared. He 
called out wildly, \'93Hey!\'94 as he went sprawling. The others stopped, assessed the situation quickly, and veered away.
\par Baley said, \'93Onto the Expressway, boy.\'94
\par The robot hesitated briefly. Robots were not allowed, unac\-companied, on the Expressway. Baley\rquote s order had been a firm one, however, and it moved aboard. Baley followed, which relieved the pressure on the robot.
\par Baley moved brusquely through the crowd of standees, forc\-ing R. Ceronimo ahead of him, making his way up to the less crowded upper level. He held on to a pole and kept one foot firmly on the robot\rquote s, again glaring down all eye contact.
\par Fifteen and a half kilometers brought him to the close-point for the Police Headquarters and he was off. B. Geronimo came off with him. It hadn\rquote t been touched, no
t a scuff. Baley delivered it at the door and accepted a receipt. He carefully checked the date, the time, and the robot\rquote s serial number, then placed the re\-
ceipt in his wallet. Before the day was over, he would check and make certain that the transaction had been computer-registered.
\par Now he was going to see the Commissioner\emdash and he knew the Commissioner. Any failing on Baley\rquote s part would be suitable cause for demotion. He was a harsh man, the Commissioner. He considered Baley\rquote s past triumphs a personal offense.

\par Demachek seemed in no hurry. She said, \'93Fastolfe is a\emdash  moderate. That\rquote s what he calls himself. He feels Aurora\emdash and the Spacer worlds generally\emdash have gone too far in their direc\-

What is the situation that you are referring to, ma\rquote am?\'94
\par \'93It seems,\'94 said Demachek, \'93that Fastolfe has become impli\-cated in a serious and unprecedented scandal. If he is clumsy, the chances are that he will undergo political destruction in a matter of we
eks. If he is superhumanly clever, perhaps he will hold out for some months. A little sooner, a little later, he could be destroyed as a political force on Aurora\emdash and }{\i\fs20 that }{\fs20 would be a real disaster for Earth, you see.\'94
\par \'93May I ask what he is accused of? Corruption? Treason?\rquote 
\par \'93Nothing that small. His personal integrity is, in any case, un\-questioned even by his enemies.\'94
\par \'93A crime of passion, then? Murder?\'94
\par \'93Not }{\i\fs20 quite }{\fs20 murder.\'94
\par \'93I don\rquote t understand, ma\rquote arn.\'94
\par \'93There are human beings on Aurora, Mr. Baley. And there are robots, too, most of them something like ours, not very much more advanced in most cases. However, there are a few humani\-form robots, robots so humaniform that they can be taken for human.
\'94
\par Baley nodded,. \'93I know that very well.\'94
\par \'93I suppose that destroying a humaniform robot is not exactly murder in the strict sense of the word.\'94
\par Baley leaned forward, eyes widening. He shouted, \'93Jehosha\-phat, woman! Stop playing games. Are you telling me that Dr. Fastolfe has killed R. Daneel?\'94
\par Roth leaped to his feet and seemed about to advance on Baley, but Undersecretary Demachek waved him back. She seemed unruffled.
\par She said, \'93Under the circumstances, I excuse your disrespect, Baley. No, R. Daneel has }{\i\fs20 not }{\fs20 been killed. He is not the only humaniform robot on Aurora. Another such robot, }{\i\fs20 not }{\fs20 R. Dan\-
eel, has been killed, if you wish to use the term loosely. To be more precise, its mind has been totally destroyed; it was placed into permanent and irreversible roblock.\'94

\par \'93Why is this roblock so important politically? I don\rquote t under\-stand.\'94
\par \'93I am not myself certain,\'94 said Demachek. \'93I do not pretend to understand Auroran politics. I gather that the humaniforms were in some way involved with the extremist plans and that the destruction has infuriated them.\'94 She wrinided her nose. 
\'93I find their politics very confusing and I will oniy mislead you if I try to interpret it.\'94
\par Baley labored to control himself under the Undersecretary\rquote s level stare. He said in a low voice, \'93Why am I here?\'94
\par \'93Because of Fastolfe. Once before you went out into space in order to solve a murder and succeeded. Fastolfe wants you to try again. You are to go to Aurora and discover who was respon\-sible for the roblock. He feels that to be his only chance of turn
\-ing back the extremists.\'94
\par \'93I am not a roboticist. I know nothing about Aurora\emdash \'94
\par \'93You knew nothing about Solaria, either, yet you managed. The point is, Baley, we are as eager to find out what really hap\-pened as Fastolfe is. We don\rquote 
t want him destroyed. If he is, Earth will be subject to a kind of hostility from these Spacer ex\-tremists that will probably be greater than anything we have yet experienced. We don\rquote t want that to happen.\'94

The spaceport was at the eastern outskirts of the City in an all-but-deserted Sector that was, strictly speaking, Outside. This was palhiated by the fact that the ticket offices and the waiting rooms were actually in the City and that the approach to the 
ship itself was by vehicle through a covered path. By tradition, all takeoffs were at night, so that a pall of darkness further deadened the effect of Outside.
\par The spaceport was not very busy, considering the populous character of Earth. Earthmen very rarely left the planet and the traffic consisted entirely of commercial activity organized by ro\-bots and Spacers.

\par With nothing less than bravado, he refused the car and in\-sisted on walking the short distance from the gate to the ship in the company of the robot who had come for him. It was just a roofed-over arcade, after all.

\par Victory? A useless gesture, Baley was certain.

\fs20 An Auroran ship!
\par He was sure of that. Outlined by a warm spotlight, it soared taller, more gracefully, and yet more powerfully than the So\-larian ships had.
\par Baley moved inside and the comparison remained in favor of Aurora. His room was larger than the ones two years before had been: more luxurious, more comfortable.
\par He knew exactly what was coming an\'e7l removed all his clothes without hesitation. (Perhaps they would be disintegrated by }{\fs20 plasma torch. }{\fs20 Certainly, he would not get them back on return\-ing to Earth\emdash if he returned. He hadn\rquote 
t the first time.)
\par He would receive no other clothes till he ha
d been thoroughly bathed, examined, dosed, and injected. He almost welcomed the humiliating procedures imposed on him. After all, it served to keep his mind off what was taldng place. He was scarcely aware of the initial acceleration and scarcely had time
 to think of the moment during which he left Earth and entered space.
\par When he was finally dressed again, he surveyed the results unhappily in a mirror. The material, whatever it was, was smooth and reflective and shifted color with any change in angle. The 
trouser legs hugged his ankles and were, in turn, covered by the tops of shoes that molded themselves softly to his feet. The sleeves of his blouse hugged his wrists and his hands were cov\-
ered by thin, transparent gloves. The top of the blouse covered his neck and an attached hood could, if desired, cover his head. He was being so covered, not for his own comfort, he knew, but to reduce his danger to the Spacers.
\par He thought, as he looked at the outfit, that he should feel un\-comfortably enclosed, uncomfortably hot, uncomfortably damp. But he did not. He wasn\rquote t, to his enormous relief, even sweating.
\par He made the reasonable deduction. He said to the robot that had walked him to the ship and was still with him, \'93Boy, are these clothes temperature-controlled?\'94
\par The robot said, \'93Indeed they are, sir. It is all-weather clothing and is considered very desirable. It is also exceedingly expen\-sive. Few on Aurora are in a position to wear it.\'94

The structure of its body resembled metal and yet had the look of something woven, something shifting slightly with move\-ment, something with colors that matched and contrasted pleas\-ingly. In short, }{\fs20 unless one }{\fs20 
looked very closely and steadily, the robot, though definitely nonhumaniform, seemed to be wearing clothing.

\par The robot left through the double door and Baley nodded grimly to himself. On his trip to Solaria, it had never occurred to him to spend the useless time crossing space in learning some\-thing useful. He had come along a bit in the last two years.
\par He tried the door the robot had just passed through. It was locked and utterly without give. He would have been enor\-mously surprised at anything else.
\par He investigated the room. There was a hyperwave screen. He handled the controls idly, received a blast of music, managed to
 lower the volume eventually, and listened with disapproval. Tinidy and discordant. The instruments of the orchestra seemed vaguely distorted.
\par He touched other contacts and finally managed to change the view. What he saw was a space-soccer game that was played, obviously, under conditions of zero-gravity. The ball flew in straight lines and the players (too many of them on each side\emdash

and consider Baley an idiot into the bargain. Daneel, however, as a robot, would follow Baley down the winding road with total patience.
\par That was one type of behavior that gave away Daneel as a robot, however humaniform he might be. An Auroran might be able to judge him a robot from a single answer to a single ques\-tion. Dance! was right as to the subtle distinctions.

able at the minimum intensity allowed by the control, but you might find that, on first use, you would wish a higher intensity, so that you might retain the familiarity of the weight 
sensation to a somewhat greater extent. Simply experiment with different levels and find the one that suits.\'94

In viewing the book-films, Baley did not attempt to memorize details. He had no intention of becoming an expert on Auroran society, nor even of passing a high school test on the subject. Rather, he wished to get the feel of it.
\par He noticed, for instance, even through the hagiographic atti\-tude of historians writing for young people, that the Auroran pioneers\emdash 
the founding fathers, the Earthpeople who had first come to Aurora to settle in the early days of interstellar travel\emdash 
 had been very much Earthpeople. Their politics, their quarrels, every facet of their behavior had been Earthish; what happened on A
urora was, in ways, similar to the events that took place when the relatively empty sections of Earth had been settled a couple of thousand years before.
\par Of course, the Aurorans had no intelligent life to encounter and to fight, no thinking organisms to pu
zzle the invaders from Earth with questions of treatment, humane or cruel. There was precious little life of any kind, in fact. So the planet was quickly settled by human beings, by their domesticated plants and ani\-
mals, and by the parasites and other organisms that were adven\-titiously brought along. And, of course, the settlers brought ro\-bots with them.
\par The first Aurorans quickly felt the planet to be theirs, since it fell into their laps with no sense of competition, and they had called the planet New Earth to begin with. That was natural, since it was the first extrasolar planet\emdash 
the first Spacer world\emdash to be settled. It was the first fruit of interstellar travel, the first dawn of an immense new era. They quickly cut the umbilical cord, however, and renamed the planet Aurora after the Roman goddess of the dawn.
\par It was the World of the Dawn. And so did the settlers from the start self-consciously declare themselves the progenitors of a new kind. A!! previous history of humanity was a dark Night and only f
or the Aurorans on this new world was the Day finally approaching.

ere settled, some from Earth, some from Aurora, but Baley paid no attention to that or to any of the de\-
tails. He was after the broad brushstrokes and he noted the two massive changes that took place and pushed the Aurorans ever farther away from their Earthly origins. These were first, the in\-
creasing integration of robots into every facet of life and second, the extension of the life-span.
\par As the robots grew more advanced and versatile, the Aurorans grew more dependent on them. But never helplessly so. No
t like the world of Solaria, Baley remembered, on which a very few human beings were in the collective womb of very many robots. Aurora was not like that.

y step in the course of human/robot interaction seemed to depend on dependence. Even the manner in which a consensus of robotic rights was reached\emdash the gradual dropping of what Dance! would call \'93unnecessary distinctions\'94\emdash 
was a sign of the dependence. To Ba
ley, it seemed not that the Aurorans were growing more humane in their attitude out of a liking for the humane, but that they were denying the robotic nature of the objects in order to remove the discomfort of having to recognize the fact that human being
s were dependent upon objects of artificial intelligence.

As for the extended life-span, that was accompanied by a slowing of the pace of history. The peaks and troughs smoothed out. There was a growing continuity and a growing consensus.
\par There was no quest
ion but that the history he was viewing grew less interesting as it went along; it became almost soporific. For those living through it, this had to be good. History was interesting to the extent that it was catastrophic and, while that might make absorbi
ng viewing, it made horrible living. Undoubt\-edly, personal lives continued to be interesting for the vast majority of Aurorans and, if the collective interaction of lives grew quiet, who would mind?
\par If the World of the Dawn had a quiet sunlit Day, who on that world would clamor for storm?

\fs20 \emdash Somewhere in the course of his viewing, Baley felt an indescribable sensation. If he had been forced to attempt a description, he would have said it was that of a momentary inversion. It was as though he had been turned inside out\emdash 
 and then back as he had been\emdash in the course of a small fraction of a second.
\par So momentary had it been that he almost missed it, ignoring it as though it had been a tiny hiccup inside himself.
\par It was only perhaps a minute later, suddenly going over the feeling in retrospect, that he remembered the sensation as something he had experienced twice before: once when travel\-ing to Solaria and once when returning to Earth from that planet.
\par It was the \'93Jump,\'94 the passage through hype
rspace that, in a timeless, spaceless interval, sent the ship across the parsecs and defeated the speed-of-light limit of the Universe. (No mystery in words, since the ship merely left the Universe and traversed something which involved no speed limit. To
tal mystery in con\-cept, however, for there was no way of describing what hyper\-space was, unless one made use of mathematical symbols which could, in any case, not be translated into anything compre\-hensible.)
\par If one accepted the fact that human beings had learned to ma\-
nipulate hyperspace without understanding the thing they manipulated, then the effect was clear, At one moment, the ship had been within microparsecs of Earth and, at the next moment, it was within microparsecs of Aurora.
\par Ideally, the Jump took zero-time\emdash literally zero\emdash and, if it were carried through with perfect smoothness, there would not, could not be any biological sensation at all. Physicists main\-
tained, however, that perfect smoothness required infinite energy so that there was always an \'93effective time\'94
 that was not quite zero, though it could be made as short as desired. It was that which produced that odd and essentially harmless feeling of in\-version.
\par The sudden realization that he was very far from Earth and very close to Aurora filled Baley with a desire to see the Spacer world.

Now if you\rquote ll imag\-ine a line from Betelgeuse to the middle star of Orion\rquote

\par Baley regarded it gravely. It was just a bright starlike object. There was no luminous arrow, going on and off, pointing to it. There was no carefully lettered inscription arced over it.
\par He said, \'93Where\rquote s the sun? Earth\rquote s star, I mean.\'94
\par \'93It\rquote s in the
 constellation Virgo, as seen from Aurora. It is a second-magnitude star. Unfortunately, the astrosimulator we have is not properly computerized and it would not be easy to point it out to you. It would, in any case, just appear to be a star, quite an ord

\fs20 Periodically, he returned to the astrosimulator and took an\-other look at space as seen from a vantage point just outside the spaceship, with himself nowhere present (apparently). Some\-
times it was just for a moment, to reassure himself that he was still not made uneasy by the infinite void. Sometimes he found himself lost in the pattern of the stars and he began lazily count\-
ing them or forming geometrical figures, rather luxuriating in the ability to do something which, on Earth, he would never have been able to do because the mounting agoraphobic uneas\-iness would quickly have overwhelmed everything else.
\par Eventually, it grew quite obvious that Aurora was brighten\-ing. It soon became easy to detect among the other dots of light, then unmistakable, and finally unavoidable. It began as a tiny sliver of light and, thereafter, it enlarged rapidly and
 began to show phases.
\par It was almost precisely a half-circle of light when Baley be\-came aware of the existence of phases.
\par Balcy inquired and Daneel said, \'93We are approaching from outside the orbital plane, Partner Elijah. Aurora\rquote s south pole is more or less in the center of its disk, somewhat into the lighted half. It is spring in the southern hemisphere.\'94

\par Baley said, \'93According to the material I have been reading, Aurora\rquote s axis is tipped sixteen degrees.\'94 He had glanced over the physical description of th
e planet with insufficient attention in his anxiety to get to the Aurorans, but he remembered that.
\par \'93Yes, Partner Elijah. Eventually, we will move into orbit about Aurora and the phases will then change rapidly. Aurora revolves more rapidly than Earth does\emdash \'94

al to o.8 Earth seconds.\'94
\par \'93Is that what the books mean when they refer to metric hours, metric minutes, and so on?\'94
\par \'93Yes. It was difficult to persuade the Aurorans, at first, to abandon the time units to which they were accustomed and both systems\emdash the standard and the metric\emdash

\par \'93Not out of friendliness, I imagine. I suspect they wish to emphasize Earth\rquote s difference. \emdash How does decimalization fit in with the year? After all, Auro
ra must have a natural period of revolution about its sun that controls the cycle of its seasons. How is that measured?\rquote 
\par Dance! said, \'93Aurora revolves about its sun in 373.5 Auroran days or in about }{\fs20 0.95 }{\fs20 Earth years. That is not considered a vital matter in chronology. Aurora accepts }{\fs20 30 }{\fs20 
of its days as equaling a month and io months as equaling a metric year. The metric year is equal to about o.8 seasonal years or about three-quarters of an Earth year. The relationship is different on each world, of course. 
Ten days is usually referred to as a decimonth. All the Spacer worlds use this system.\'94
\par \'93Surely, there must be some convenient way of following the cycle of the seasons?\'94
\par \'93Each world has its seasonal year, too, but it is little regarded. One can, by computer, convert any day\emdash past or present\emdash into its position in the seasonal year if, for any reason, such informa\-
tion is desired. And this is true on any world, where conversion
 to and from the local days is also as easily possible. And, of course, Partner Elijah, any robot can do the same and can guide human activity where the seasonal year or local time is relevant. The advantage of metricized units is that it supplies humanit
y with a unified chronometry that involves little more than deci\-mal point shifts.\'94

\par \'93How do you know?\'94
\par \'93It is our destination. Then, too, it could not be Earth, for in-stance, since Aurora\rquote s sun, Tau Ceti, is only ninety percent the mass of Earth\rquote s sun. Tau Ceti is a little cooler, therefore, and its light has a distinct orange tinge to 
fresh and unaccustomed Earth eyes. You may have already seen the characteristic color of Aurora\rquote s sun in the reflection upon the upper surface of the cloud bank. You will certainly see it in the appearance of the landscape\emdash

\par \'93None. It may have been the result of the uneasiness that arose from subliminal agoraphobia. Staring at seemingly motion\-less space, I felt no perceptible illness, but it may have lain just under the surface, creating a gathering uneasiness.\'94

\par \'93The fault was ours, Partner Elijah. Knowing of your dislike for open spaces, it was wrong to subject you to astrosimulation or, having done so, to subject you to no closer supervision.\'94
\par Baley shook his head in annoyance. \'93Don\rquote t say that, Daneel. I have supervision enough. The question in my mind is how closely I am to be supervised on Aurora itself.\'94

\par He would, he knew, have to make do with the memory. On Aurora, he would on no account be allowed to smoke. There was no tobacco on any of the Spacer worlds and, if he had had any on him to begin with, it would have been removed and de\-stroyed.

This has, in point of fact, been considered, Partner Elijah. The ship has been carefully studied. Any signs of sabotage would be detected.\'94
\par \'93Are you sure? One hundred percent certain?\'94
\par \'93Nothing of this sort can be absolutely certain. Giskard and I were comfortable, however, with the thought that the certainty was quite high and that we might proceed with minimal expec\-tation of disaster.\'94
\par \'93And if you were wrong?\'94
\par Something like a small sign of spasm crossed Daneel\rquote s face, as though he were being asked to consider something that inter\-fered with the smooth working of the positronic pathways in his brain. He said, \'93But we have not been wrong.\'94
\par \'93You cannot say that. We arc approaching the landing and that is sure to be the danger moment. In fact, at this point there is no need to sabotage the ship. My personal danger is greatest now\emdash right now. I can\rquote t hide in this room if I
\rquote m to disembark at Aurora. I will have to pass through the ship and be within reach of others. Have you taken precautions to keep the landing safe?\'94 (He was being petty\emdash 
striking out at Dance! needlessly because he was chafing at his long imprisonment\emdash and at the indignity of his moment of collapse.)
\par But Dance! said calmly, \'93We have, Partner Elijah. And, inci\-dentally, we have landed. We arc now resting on the surface of Aurora.\'94
\par For a moment, Baley was bewildered. He looked around wildly, but of course there was nothing to see but an enclosing room. He had felt and heard nothing of what Dance! had de\-scribed. None of the acceleration, or heat, or wind whistle. \emdash 
Or had Dance! deliberately brought up the matter of his personal danger once again, in order to make sure he would not think of other unsettling\emdash but minor\emdash matters.
\par Baley said, \'93And yet there\rquote s still the matter of getting off the ship. How do I do that without being vulnerable to possible ene\-mies?\'94

\fs20 Dance! walked to one wall and touched a spot upon it. The wall promptly split in two, the two halves moving apart. Balcy found himself looking into a long cylinder, a tunnel.
\par Giskard had entered the room at that moment from the other side and said, \'93Sir, the three of us will move through the exit tube. Others have it under observation from without. At the other end of the tube, Dr. Fastolfe is waiting.\'94
\par \'93We have taken every precaution,\'94 said Daneel.
\par Baley muttered, \'93My apologies, Daneel\emdash Giskard.\'94 He moved into the exit tube somberly. Every effort to assure that precau\-tions had been taken also assured him that those precautions were thought necessary.
\par Baley liked to think he was no coward, but he was on a strange planet, with no way of telling friend from enemy, with no way of taking comfort in anything familiar (except, of course, Dan
ce!). At crucial moments, he thought with a shiver, he would be without enclosure to warm him and to give him re\-lief.

and smiling. He was tall and thin, with light brown hair that was not very thick, and there were, of course, his ears. It was the cars that Baley remem\-
bered, even after three years. Large ears, standing away from his head, giving him a vaguely humorous appearance, a pleasant homeliness. It was the ears that made Baley smile, rather than Fastolfe\rquote s welcome.
\par Baley wondered briefly if Auroran medical technology did not extend to the minor plastic surgery required to correct the un\-gainliness of those ears. \emdash But then, it might well be that Fas\-tolfc liked their appearan
ce as Baley himself (rather to his surprise) did. There is something to be said about a face that makes one smile.
\par Perhaps Fastolfe valued being liked at first glance. Or was it that he found it useful to be underestimated? Or just different?
\par Fastolfe said, \'93Plainclothesman Elijah Baley. I remember you well, even though I persist in thinking of you as possessing the face of the actor who portrayed you.\'94

\fs20 \'93Thank you.\'94 With calculated suddenness, he thrust out his hand at Fastolfe.
\par Fastolfe hesitated perceptibly. Then he took Baley\rquote s hand, holding it gingerly\emdash and not for long\emdash and said, \'93I shall assume you are not a walking sack of infection, Mr. Balcy.\'94
\par Then he said ruefully, staring at his hands, \'93I must admit, though, that my hands have been treated with an inert film that doesn\rquote t feel entirely comfortable. I\rquote m a creature of the irrational fears of my society.\'94
\par Baley shrugged. \'93So are we all. I do not relish the thought of being Outside\emdash in the open air, that is. For that matter, I do not relish having had to come to Aurora under the circumstances in which I find myself.\'94
\par \'93I understand that well, Mr. Baley. I have a closed car for you here and, when we come to my establishment, we will do our best to continue to keep you enclosed.\'94
\par \'93Thank you, but in the course of my stay on Aurora, I feel that it will be necessary for me to stay Outside on occasion. I am prepared for that\emdash as best I can be.\'94
\par \'93I understand, but we will inflict the Outside on you only when it is necessary. That is not now the case, so please consent to be enclosed.\'94
\par The car was waiting in the shadow of the tunnel and there would scarcely be a trace of Outside in passing from the latter to the former. Behind him, Baley was aware of both D
aneel and Giskard, quite dissimilar in appearance but both identical in grave and waiting attitude\emdash and both endlessly patient.
\par Fastolfe opened the back door and said, \'93Please to get in.\'94
\par Baley entered. Quickly and smoothly, Daneel entered behind him, while
 Giskard, virtually simultaneously, in what seemed a!-most like a well-choreographed dance movement, entered on the other side. Baley found himself wedged, but not oppressively so, between them. In fact, he welcomed the thought that, between himself and t
he Outside, on both sides, was the thickness of a robotic body.
\par But there was no Outside. Fastolfe climbed into the front scat and, as the door closed behind him, the windows blanked out and a soft, artificial light suffused the interior.

There was the faintest feeling of acceleration and then a vague, barely noticeable sensation of motion.
\par Fastolfe said, \'93This is a secure passage, Mr. Baley. I have gone to considerable trouble to make certain that as few people as possible know you will be in this car and certainly you will not be detected within it. The trip by car\emdash 
which rides on air-jets, by the way, so that it is an airfoil, actually\emdash will not take long, but, if you wish, you can seize the opportunity to rest. You are quite safe now.\'94
\par \'93You speak,\'94 said Balcy, \'93as though you think I\rquote m in danger. I was protected to the point of imprisonment on the ship\emdash and again now.\'94 Baley looked about the small, encl
osed interior of the car, within which he was hemmed by the frame of metal and opacifled glass, to say nothing of the metallic frame of two ro\-bots.
\par Fastolfe laughed lightly. \'93I am overreacting, I know, but feel\-ing runs high on Aurora. You arrive here at a time of crisis for us and I would rather be made to look silly by overreacting than to run the terrible risk that undcrrcacting entails.\'94

\par Baley said, \'93I believe you understand, Dr. Fasto!fc, that my failure here would be a blow to Earth.\'94
\par \'93I understand that well. I am as determined as you are to pre\-vent your failure. Believe me.\'94
\par \'93I do. Furthermore, my failure here, for whatever reason, will also be my persona! and professional ruin on Earth.\'94
\par Fastolfe turned in his seat to look at Balcy with a shocked ex\-pression. \'93Really? That would not be warranted.\'94
\par Baley shrugged. \'93I agree, but it will happen. I will be the ob\-vious target for a desperate Earth government.\'94

Baley did not experience the Outside at the other end of the trip, either. When he emerged from the airfoil, he was in an un\-derground garage and a small elevator brought him up to ground level (as it turned out).
\par He was ushered into a sunny room and, as he passed through the direct rays of the sun (yes, faintly orange), he shrank away a bit.

\par There was no answering smile from Fastolfe. He said seri\-ously, \'93No, but I want them to be with you at all times.\'94

\par \'93Quite a few. We arc not at the Solarian level of ten thousand robots to a human being, but I have more than the average number\emdash fifty-seven. The house is a large one and it serves as my office and my workshop as well. Then, t

\par \'93It was no casual choice, I assure you, Mr. Baley. Giskard is my majordomo and my right hand. He has been with me all my adult life.\'94
\par \'93Yet you sent him on the trip to get mc. I am honored,\'94 said Baley.

I do not think, Mr. Baley, that on Earth the population is accustomed to what I might term natural food. We are having shrimp salad, together with bread and cheese, milk, if you wish, or any of an assortment of fruit juices. It\rquote 
s all very simple. Ice cream for dessert.\'94
\par \'93All traditional Earth dishes,\'94 said Baley, \'93which exist now in their original form only in Earth\rquote s ancient literature.\'94
\par \'93None of it is entirely common here on Aurora, but I didn\rquote t think it made sense to subject you to our own version of gour\-met dining, which involves food items and spices of Auroran varieties. The taste would have to be acquired.\'94
\par He rose. \lquote Please come with me, Mr. Balcy. There will just be the two of us and we will not stand on ceremony or indulge in unnecessary dining ritual.\'94
\par \'93Thank you,\'94 said Baley. \'93I accept that as a kindness. I have relieved the tedium of the trip here by a rather intensive view\-ing of material relating to Aurora and I know that proper polite\-
ness requires many aspects to a ceremonial meal that I would dread.\'94

\par Baley said, \'93Could we break ceremony even to the extent of talking business over the meal, Dr. Fastolfe? I must not lose time unnecessarily.\'94
\par \'93I sympathize with that point of view. We will indeed talk business and I imagine I can rely on you to say nothing to any\-one concerning that lapse. I would not want to be expelled from polite society.\'94 He chuckled, then said, \'93

The room that Balcy left was a spare one: several chairs, a chest of drawers, something that looked like a piano but had brass valves in the place of keys, some abstract designs on the walls that seemed to
 shimmer with light. The floor was a smooth checkerboard of several shades of brown, perhaps designed to be reminiscent of wood, and although it shone with highlights as though freshly waxed, it did not feel slippery underfoot.
\par The dining room, though it h
ad the same floor, was like it in no other way. It was a long rectangular room, overburdened with decoration. It contained six large square tables that were clearly modules that could be assembled in various fashions. A bar was to be found along one short
 wall, with gleaming bottles of various colors standing before a curved mirror that seemed to lend a nearly infinite extension to the room it reflected. Along the other short wall were four recesses, in each of which a robot waited.
\par Both long walls were mos
aics, in which the colors slowly changed. One was a planetary scene, though Baley could not tell if it were Aurora, or another planet, or something completely imaginary. At one end there was a wheat field (or something of that sort) filled with elaborate 
farm machinery, all robot-con\-trolled. As one\rquote s eye traveled along the length of the wall, that gave way to scattered human habitations, becoming, at the other end, what Baley felt to be the Auroran version of a City.
\par The other long wall was astronomical. A planet, blue-white, lit by a distant sun, reflected light in such a manner that not the closest examination could free one from the thought that it was slowly rotating. The stars that surrounded it\emdash 
some faint, some bright\emdash seemed also to be changing their patterns, though when the eye concentrated on some small grouping and remained fixed there, the stars seemed immobile.
\par Baley found it all confusing and repellent.
\par Fastolfe said, \'93Rather a work of art, Mr. Baley. Far too expen\-sive to be worth it, though, but Fanya would have it. \emdash Fanya is my current partner.\'94

\fs20 \'93Wifi she be joining us, Dr. Fastolfe?\'94

\par \'93Yes, of course.\'94
\par \'93Come. Please take your scat.\'94
\par One of the tables was set with dishes, cups, and elaborate cutlery, not all of which were familiar to Baley. In the center was a tall, somewhat tapering cylinder that looked as though it might be a gigantic chess pawn made out of a gray rocky mate\-rial.

\par Baley, as he sat down, could not resist reaching toward it and touching it with a finger.
\par Fastolfe smiled. \'93It\rquote s a spicer. It possesses simple controls that
 allows one to use it to deliver a fixed amount of any of a dozen different condiments on any portion of a dish. To do it properly, one picks it up and performs rather intricate evolutions that are meaningless in themselves but that are much valued by fas
hion\-able Aurorans as symbols of the grace and delicacy with which meals should be served. When I was younger, I could, with my thumb and two fingers, do the triple genuflection and produce salt as the spicer struck my palm. Now if I tried it, I\rquote 
d run a good risk of braining my guest. I trust you won\rquote t mind if I do not try.\'94
\par \'93I urge you not to try, Dr. Fastolfe.\'94
\par A robot pl
aced the salad on the table, another brought a tray of fruit juices, a third brought the bread and cheese, a fourth adjusted the napkins. All four operated in close coordination, weaving in and out without collision or any sign of difficulty. Balcy watche
d them in astonishment.

\fs20 He tossed the

.
 It went up again in reverse and was caught on the side of the right palm and then again on the left palm. After this third genuflection, it was lifted with sufficient force to produce a ftp. Fastolfe caught it in his right fist, with his left hand nearby

\par Fastolfe said, \'93It is a childish display to the scientific mind and the effort is totally disproportionate to the end, which is, of c

\par \'93Very little concerning robotics is dealt with on Earth\emdash \'94
\par \'93Earth\rquote s strong antirobot bias is well-known on the Spacer worlds.\'94
\par \'93
But the Earthly origin of robots is obvious to any person on Earth who thinks about it. It is well-known that hyperspatial travel was developed with the aid of robots and, since the Spacer worlds could not have been settled without hypcrspatial travel, it
 follows that robots existed before settlement had taken place and while Earth was still the only inhabited planet. Robots were therefore invented on Earth by Earthpcop!e.\'94

n. They would refuse to believe it if they were told that she died after having lived scarcely more than a hundred metric years. And yet you know her only as an early pioneer.\'94

\fs20 \'93Not directly, but in a way. You must understand that nu\-merous legends cluster about her name. Most\rquote  of them are un\-doubtedly untrue, but they cling to her, nonetheless. One of the most famous legends\emdash 
and one of the least likely to be true\emdash  concerns a robot manufactured in those primitive days that, through some accident on the production lines, turned out to have telepathic abilities\emdash \'94
\par \'93What!\'94
\par \'93A legend! I told you it was a legend\emdash and undoubtedly un\-true! Mind you, there is some theoretical reason for supposing this might be possible, though no one has ever presented a plau\-
sible design that could even begin to incorporate such an ability. That it could have appeared in positronic brains as crude and simple as those in the prehypcrspat
ial era is totally unthinkable. That is why we are quite certain that this particular talc is an in\-vention. But let mc go on anyway, for it points out a moral.\'94
\par \'93By all means, go on.\'94
\par \'93The robot, according to the tale, could read minds. And when asked questions, he read the questioner\rquote 
s mind and told the questioner what he wanted to hear. Now the First Law of Robotics states quite clearly that a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a person to come to harm, but }{\fs20 t~ }{\fs20 robots generally
 that means physical harm. A robot who can read minds, however, would surely decide that disap\-
pointment or anger or any violent emotion would make the human being feeling those emotions unhappy and the robot would interpret the inspiring of such emotions under the head\-ing of \lquote harm.\rquote 
 If, then, a telepathic robot knew that the truth might disappoint or enrage a questioner or cause that person to feel envy or unhappiness, he would tell a pleasing lie, instead. Do you see that?\'94
\par \'93Yes, of course.\'94
\par \'93So the robot lied even to Susan Calvin herself. The lies could not long continue, for different people were told different things that were not only inconsistent among themselves but unsup\-

\par }{\fs20 Baley said, \'93And something like this, I take it, was what hap\-pened to Jander Panel. He was faced with a contradiction in terms and his brain burned out?\'94
\par \'93It\rquote s what }{\i\fs20 appears }{\fs20 to have happened, though that is not as easy to bring about as it would have been in Susan Calvin\rquote 
s day. Possibly because of the legend, roboticists have always been careful to make it as difficult as pos
sible for contradictions to arise. As the theory of positronic brains has grown more subtle and as the practice of positronic brain design has grown more intricate, increasingly successful systems have been devised to have all situations that might arise 
resolve into nonequality, so that some action can always be taken that wifi be interpreted as obeying the First Law.\'94
\par \'93Well, then, you can\rquote t burn out a robot\rquote s brain. Is that what you\rquote re saying? Because if you arc, what happened to Jander?\'94
\par \'93It\rquote s }{\i\fs20 not }{\fs20 what I\rquote m saying. The increasingly successful systems I speak of, are never }{\i\fs20 completely }{\fs20 
successful. They cannot be. No matter how subtle and intricate a brain might be, there is always some way of setting up a contradiction. That is a fundamental truth of mathematics. It will remain forever impossible to pro\-
duce a brain so subtle and intricate as to reduce the chance of contradiction to zero. Never quite to zero. However, the systems have been made so close to zero that to bring about a mental freeze-out by settin

on you. What happened to Jander did not require my physical }{\fs20 presence. As it happens, although not actually in my estab\-lishment, Jander was not far away geographically, but it wouldn\rquote

Law. However, I know that I am of great value, both in terms of investment of material, labor, and time, and in terms of scientific importance. It would there\-

d through and the door then closed promptly.
\par While the door was open, the Personal had seemed like a room that flatly served its purpose. A sink, a stall }{\fs20 (presumably }{\fs20 equipped with a shower arrangement), a tub, a translucent half-door with a toilet seat bey
ond in all likelihood. There were sev\-eral devices that he did not quite recognize. He assumed they were intended for the fulfillment of personal services of one sort or another.
\par He had little chance to study any of these, for in a moment }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 was all gone and he was left to wonder if what he had seen had really been there at all or if the devices had seemed to exist be\-cause they were what he had expected to see.

\par As the door closed, the room darkened, for there was no win\-dow. When the door was completely closed, the room lit up again, but nothing of what he had seen returned. It was daylight and he was Outside\emdash or so it appeared.
\par There was open sky above, with clouds drifting across it in a }{\fs20 fashion just regular enough to seem clearly unreal. On every side }{\fs20 there seemed an outstretching of greenery moving in equally repetitive fashion.
\par He felt the familiar knotting of his stomach that arose when\-ever he found himself Outside\emdash but he was }{\i\fs20 not }{\fs20 Outside. He had walked into a windowless room. It had to be a trick of the light\-ing.
\par He stared directly ahead of him and slowly slid his feet for\-ward. He put his hands out before him. Slowly. Staring hard.
\par His hands touched the smoothness of a wall. He followed the flatness to either side. He touched what he had seen to be a sink }{\fs20 in that moment of }{\fs20 original vision and, guided by his hands, he could see it now\emdash 
faintly, faintly against the overpowering sen\-}{\fs20 sation of light.

He found the faucet, but no water came from it. He followed its curve ba
ckward and found nothing that was the equivalent of the familiar handles that would control the flow of water. He did find an oblong strip whose slight roughness marked it off from the surrounding wall. As his fingers slid along it, he pushed slightly and
 experimentally against }{\i\fs20 it }{\fs20 and at once the greenery, which stretched far beyond the plane along which his fingers told him the wall existed, was parted by a rivulet of water, fall\-
ing quickly from a height toward his feet with a loud noise of splashing.
\par He jumped backward in automatic panic, but the water ended before it reached his feet. It didn\rquote t stop coming, but it didn\rquote 
t reach the floor. He put his hand out. It was not water, but a light-illusion of water. It did not wet his hand; he felt nothing. But his eyes stubbornly resisted the evidence. They saw water.
\par He followed the rivulet upward and eventually came to some\-thing that }{\i\fs20 was }{\fs20 water\emdash a thinner stream issuing from the faucet. It was cold.
\par His fingers found the oblong again and experimented, pushing here and there, The temperature shifted quickly and he found the spot that produced water of suitable tepidity.
\par He did not find any soap. Somewhat reluctantly, he began to rub his unsoaped hands against each other under what seemed a natural spring that shoul
d have been soaking him from head to foot but did not. And as though the mechanism could read his mind or, more likely, was guided by the rubbing together of his hands, he felt the water grow soapy, while the spring he did! didn\rquote 
t see grew bubbles and developed into foam.
\par Still reluctant, he bent over the sink and rubbed his face with the same soapy water. He felt the bristles of his beard, but knew that there was no way in which he could translate the equip\-ment of this room into a shave without instruction.
\par He finished and held his hands helplessly under the water. How did he stop the soap? He did not have to ask. Presumably, his hands, no longer rubbing either themselves or his face, con\-trolled that. The water lost its soapy feel and the soap was rinsed 
from his hands. He splashed the water against his face\emdash  without rubbing\emdash and that was rinsed too. Without the help of vision and with the clumsiness of one unused to the process, he managed to soak his shirt badly.

\par He stepped back, eyes closed, holding his\rquote  head forward to avoid dripping more water on his clothes. Stepping back was, apparently, the key action, for he felt the warm flow of an air current. He placed his face within it and then his hands.
\par He opened his eyes and found the spring no longer flowing. He used his hands and found that he could feel no real water.
\par The knot in his stomach had long since dissolved into irrita\-tion. He recognized that Personals varied enormously from world to world, but somehow this nonsense of simulated Outside went too far.
\par On Earth, a Personal was a huge community chamber re\-stricted to one gender, with private cubicles to which one had a key. On Solaria, one entered a Personal through a narrow corri\-
dor appended to one side of a house, as though Solarians hoped that it would not be considered a part of their home. In both worlds, however, though so different in every possible way, the Personals were clearly defined and the function of everything in t
hem could not be mistaken. Why should there be, on Aurora, this elaborate pretense of rusticity that totally masked every part of a Personal?
\par Why?
\par At any rate, his annoyance gave him little emotional room in which to feel uneasy over the pretense of Outside. He moved in the direction in which he recalled having seen the translucent half-door.
\par It was not the correct direction. He found it only by following the wall slowly and after barking various parts of his body against protuberances.
\par In the end, he found himself urinating into the illusion of a small pond that did not seem to be receiving the stream prop\-
erly. His knees told him that he was aiming correctly between the sides of what he took to be a urinal and he told himself that if he were using the wrong receptacle or misjudging his aim, the fault was not his.
\par For a moment, when done, he considered finding the sink again for a final hand rinse and decided against it. He just couldn\rquote t face the search and that false waterfall.
\par Instead, he found, by groping, the door through which he had entered, but he did not know he had found it until his hand

\par For the first time, there was a sense of distance and on the ho\-rizon one could see a dwefflng place: low-roofed, broad, and so green in color that it almost melted into the countryside.

d }{\i\fs20 it }{\fs20 protects itself, except at times and in places where it must serve us or save us even at the price of harm to itself. Nowhere else, neither on Earth nor in the other Spacer worlds, is this so nearly true as here on Aurora.\'94

\par Fastolfe said, \'93You know we didn\rquote t, if you have viewed books on our history. Aurora had vegetation and animal life when we arrived\emdash

\par \'93It might. And if such an encounter is i~mminent, all the more reason why we should not be passively waiting. For we are growing passive, Mr. Baley. No new Spacer world has been set\-tled in two and a half centuries. Our worlds are so tame, so de\-
lightful, we do not wish to leave them. This world was originally settled, you s
ee, because Earth had grown so unpleasant that the risks and dangers of new and empty worlds seemed preferable by comparison. By the time our fifty Spacer worlds were developed\emdash Solaria last of all\emdash 
there was no longer any push, any need to move out elsewhere. And Earth itself had retreated to its underground caves of steel. The End. Finis.\'94
\par \'93You don\rquote t really mean that.\'94
\par \'93If we stay as we are? If we remain placid and comfortable and unmoving? Yes, I do mean that. Humanity must expand its range somehow if it is to continue to flourish. One method of ex\-
pansion is through space, through a constant pioneering reach toward other worlds. If we fail in this, some other civilization that is undergoing such expansion will reach us and we will not be able to stand against its dynamism.\'94
\par \'93You expect a space war\emdash like a hyperwave shoot-\rquote em-up.\'94
\par \'93No, I doubt that that would be necessary. A civilization that is expanding through space will not need our few worlds and will probably be too intellectually advanced to feel the need to batter its way into hegemony here. If, however, we are sur\-
rounded by a more lively, a more vibrant civilization, we will wither away by the mere force of the comparison; we will die of the realization of what we have become and of the potential we have wasted. Of course, we might substitute other expansions
\emdash  an expansion of scientific understanding or of cultural vigor, for instance. I fear, however, that these expansions are not separa\-ble. To fade in one is to fade in all. Certainly, we are fading in all. We live too long. We are too comfortable.

\fs20 \'93And if I succeeded in working out a theoretical structure that would imply a humaniform positronic brain, I would need a humaniform body to place it in. The brain does not exist by it\-
self, you understand. It interacts with the body, so that a humaniform brain in a nonhumaniform body would become, to an extent, itself nonhuman.\'94
\par \'93Are you sure of that?\'94
\par \'93Quite. You have only to compare Daneel with Giskard.\'94
\par \'93Then Daneel was constructed as an experimental device for furthering the understanding of the human brain?\'94
\par \'93You have it. I labored two decades at the task with Sarton. There were numerous failures that had to be discarded. Daneel was the first true success and, of course, I kept him for further study\emdash and out of\'94\emdash

\par \'93And Daneel\rquote s stay on Earth with me, three years ago, was his first assigned task?\'94
\par \'93His first of any importance, yes. When Sarton was murdered, we needed something that was a robot and could withstand the infectious diseases of Earth and yet looked enough like a man to get around the antirobotic prejudices of Earth\rquote s people.
\'94
\par \'93An astonishing coincidence that Daneel should be right at hand at that time.\'94
\par \'93Oh? Do you believe in coincidences? It is my feeling that any time at which a development as rev
olutionary as the humaniform robot came into being, some task that would require its use would present itself. Similar tasks had probably been presenting themselves regularly in all the years that Daneel did not exist\emdash 
 and because Daneel did not exist, other solutions and devices had to be used.\'94

\par \'93What falsehoods?\'94
\par \'93It is not just the destruction of one robot they attribute to me. That is bad enough and just might suffice. They are whispering\emdash it is only a whisper as yet\emdash that the death is merely an experiment of mine and a dangerous, successful o

and since Dr. Fastolfe has fifty-seven robots in his establishment, that means, if we combine the two, that there are seventy-seven robots available, altogether. Are there any other establishments whose robots may mingle with yours indistinguishably?\'94

\par \'93Ignorance,\'94 said Baley slowly, \'93
may mean nothing. A person may not know how to get to a certain place and yet may just happen to reach it while walking blindly. One might talk to Jander and, all unknowingly, push the button for mental freeze-out.\'94

\par \'93A great one. I imagine that a mental freeze-out through posi\-tronic drift might have a probability of }{\i\fs20 1 }{\fs20 in }{\fs20 1012; }{\fs20 that by acci\-dental pattern-building }{\fs20 1 in }{\fs20 io~\'b0\'b0

\par Her arm remained in the air for a moment and, after a few more moments, a robot appeared with a tray. He was patently even more primitive thaxi Giskard, but he distributed the tea\-
cups, the small sandwiches, and the bite-sized bits of pastry smoothly. He poured tea with what amounted to grace.
\par Baley said curiously, \'93How do you do that, Gladia?\'94

\par \'93You lift your arm whenever you want something and the ro\-bots always know what it is. How did this one know you wanted tea served?\'94
\par \'93It\rquote s not difficult. Every time I lift my arm, it distorts a small electromagnetic field that is maintained continuously across the room. Slightly different positions of my hand and fingers pro\-

Nevertheless, he did not want to fail to notice them. He wanted them to fail to be there. He said, \'93Gladia, I want to be alone with you. Not even robots. \emdash Giskard, join Daneel. You can stand guard from there.\'94
\par \'93Yes, sir,\'94 said Giskard, brought suddenly to awareness and re\-sponse by the sound of his name.

\par \'93Perhaps we will now proceed to find out,\'94 said Baley coolly, \'93without Dr. Fastolfe present to interfere.\'94
 He plucked one of the small sandwiches out of the dish with a small fork (there was no point in using his fingers and perhaps making the entire
 dish unusable to Gladia), scraped it off onto his own plate, popped it into his mouth, and then sipped at his tea.
\par She matched him sandwich for sandwich, sip for sip. If he were going to be cool, so was she, apparently.
\par \'93Gladia,\'94 said Baley, \'93it~is important that I know, exactly, the relationship between you and Dr. Fastolfe. You live near him and the two of you form what is virtually a single robotic house\-
hold. He is clearly concerned for you. He has made no effort to defend his own innocence, aside from the mere statement that he is innocent, but he defends you strongly the moment I harden my questioning.\'94

\par \'93Yes, he has.\'94
\par \'93Have you asked him whether Fanya is his wife or merely his companion? Whether he has children?\'94
\par Baley stirred uneasily. He might have asked such questions, of course. In the close quarters of crowded Earth
, however, privacy was cherished, precisely because it had all but perished. It was virtually impossible on Earth not to know all the facts about the family arrangements of others, so one never asked and pre\-
tended ignorance. It was a universally maintained fraud.

\par He said, \'93I have not yet asked. Tell me.\'94
\par Gladia said, \'93Fanya is his wife. He has been married a num\-ber of times, consecutively of course, though simultaneous mar\-riage for either or both sexes is not entirely unheard of on Aurora.\'94
 The bit of mild distaste with which she said that brought an equally mild defense. \'93It }{\i\fs20 is }{\fs20 unheard of on Solaria.
\par \'93However, Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s current marriage will probably soon be dissolved. Both will then be free to make new attachments, though often either or both parties do not wait for dissolution to do that. \emdash I don\rquote 
t say I understand this casual way of treating the matter, Elijah, but it is how Aurorans build their rela\-
tionships. Dr. Fastolfe, to my knowledge, is rather straitlaced. He always maintains one marriage or another and seeks nothing outside of it. On Aurora, that is considered old-fashioned and rather silly.\'94
\par Baley nodded. \'93I\rquote ve gathered something of this in my reading. Marriage takes place when there\rquote s the intention to have children, I understand.\'94
\par \'93In theory, that is so, but I\rquote m told hardly anyone takes that seriously these days. Dr. Fastolfe already has two children and can\rquote t hav
e any more, but he still marries and applies for a third. He gets turned down, of course, and knows he will. Some people don\rquote t even bother to apply.\'94
\par \'93Then why bother marrying?\'94
\par \'93There are social advantages to it. It\rquote s rather complicated and, not being an Auroran, I\rquote m not sure I understand it.\'94
\par \'93Well, never mind. Tell me about Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s children.\'94

\par Baley, flushing slightly, was about to say that this was not at all his intention, but, of course, it was and he would gain noth\-ing by denying it. He said in a soft growl, \'93Well, then, go ahead.\'94

\fs20 Did the fact that the litter remained upset Gladia\emdash and would it make her less self-controlled in her response? If so, it had bet\-ter remain\emdash 
but Baley did not really hope for much, for he could see no signs of Gladia being disturbed over the mess or even of her being aware of it.
\par Gladia\rquote s eyes had fallen to her lap again and her face seemed to sink lower and to become a touch harsh, as though she were reaching into a past she would much rather obliterate.
\par She said, \'93You caught a glimpse of my life on Solaria. It was not a happy one, but I knew no other. It was not until I experi\-enced a touch of happiness that I suddenly knew exactly to what an extent\emdash and how intensively\emdash 
my earlier life was not happy. The first hint came through you, Elijah.\'94
\par \'93Through me?\'94 Baley was caught by surprise.
\par \'93Yes, Elijah. Our last meeting on Solaria\emdash I hope you re\-member it, Elijah\emdash taught me something. I touched you! I re\-

but it meant a great deal to me.\'94
\par She looked up, meeting his eyes defiantly. \'93It meant }{\i\fs20 ever thing }{\fs20 to me. It changed my life. Remember, Elijah, that until then, after my few years of childhood, I had never touched a man\emdash or any human being, actually\emdash 
except for my husband. And I touched my husband very rarely. I had }{\i\fs20 viewed }{\fs20 men on trimensic, of course, and in the process I had become entirely fa\-miliar with every physical aspect of males, every part of them. I had nothing to 
learn, in that respect.
\par \'93But I had no reason to think that one man felt much different from another. I knew what my husband\rquote s skin felt like, what his hands felt like when he could bring himself to touch me, what\emdash  everything. I had no reason to think that 
anything would be different with any man. There was no pleasure in contact with my husband, but why should there be? Is there particular plea\-
sure in the contact of my fingers with this table, except to the extent that I might appreciate its physical smoothness?

As I look back on it, I can see that the sexual experience was perfunctory and mechanical. I never had an orgasm. Not once. That such a thing existed I gathered from some of my reading, but the descriptions merely puzzled me and\emdash 
since they were to be found only in imported books\emdash Solarian books never dealt with sex\emdash I could not trust them. I thought they were merely ex\-otic metaphors.
\par \'93Nor could I\rquote  experiment\emdash successfully, at least\emdash with autoerot\-

Nor is there any other kind of society on Solaria.
\par \'93From something I occasionally read, I had an idea of how one might go about masturbating and, on a number of occasions, I made a halfhearted attempt to do what was described. I could not carr
y it through. The taboo against touching human flesh made even my own seem forbidden and unpleasant to me. I could brush my hand against my side, cross one leg over an\-other, feel the pressure of thigh against thigh, but these were ca\-
sual touches, unregarded. To make the process of touch an in\-strument of deliberate pleasure was different. Every fiber of me knew it shouldn\rquote t be done and, because I knew that, the plea\-sure wouldn\rquote t come.

\par \'93Ordinary robots do not wear clothes, but they are so de\-signed as to give the effect of wearing clothes. I know robots well, having lived on Solaria, and I have a certain amount of ar\-tistic talent\emdash \'94

\par Gladia nodded in acknowledgment. \'93I constructed a few designs for new mode
ls that would possess, in my opinion, more style and more interest than some of those in use in Aurora. Some of my paintings, based on those designs, are on the walls here. Others I have in other places in this establishment.\'94
\par Baley\rquote s eyes moved to the pai
ntings. He had seen them. They were of robots, unmistakably. They were not naturalistic, but seemed elongated and unnaturally curved. He noted now that the distortions were so designed as to stress, quite cleverly, those portions which, now that he looked
 at them from a new perspec\-tive, suggested clothing. Somehow there was an impression of ser\-vants\rquote 
 costumes he had once viewed in a book devoted to the Victorian England of medieval times. Did Gladia know of these things or was it a merely chance, if circumstantial, similarity? It was a question of no account, probably, but not something (per\-
haps) to be forgotten.
\par When he had first noticed them, he had thought it was Gladia\rquote s way of surrounding herself with robots in imitation of life on Solaria. She hated
 that life, she said, but that was only a product of her thinking mind. Solaria had been the only home she had really known and that is not easily sloughed off\emdash 
 perhaps not at all. And perhaps that remained a factor in her painting, even if her new occupation gave her a more plausible motive.
\par She was speaking. \'93I was successful. Some of the robot\-manufacturing concerns paid well for my designs and there were numerous cases of existing robots being resurfaced according to my directions. There was a certain s

None of it was in the least imaginative and it amused me to buy what I considered more appropriate garb. That meant mea\-suring him quite accurately, since I intended to have my designs made to order\emdash and }{\i\fs20 that }{\fs20 
meant having him remove his clothing in stages.
\par \'93He did so\emdash and it was only when he was completely un\-clothed that I quite realized how close to human he was. Nothing was lacking and those portions which might be expected to be erectile were,
 indeed, erectile. Indeed, they were under what, in a human, would be called conscious control. Jander could tumesce and detumesce on order. He told me so when I asked him if his penis was functional in that respect. I was curious and he demonstrated.

\par \'93You must understand that, although he looked very much like a man, I knew he was a robot. I have a certain hesitation about touching men\emdash you understand\emdash 
and I have no doubt that played a part in my inability to have satisfactory sex with Aurorans. But this was not a man and I had been with robots all my life. I could touch Jander freely.
\par \'93It didn\rquote t take me long to realize that I enjoyed touching him and it didn\rquote t take Jander long to realize that I enjoyed it. He was a finely tuned robot who followed the Three L
aws carefully. To have failed to give joy when he could would have been to disap\-
point. Disappointment could be reckoned as harm and he could not harm a human being. He took infinite care then to give me joy and, because I saw in him the desire to give joy
, something I never saw in Auroran men, I was indeed joyful and, eventually, I found out, to the full, I think, what an orgasm is.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93You were, then, completely happy?\'94
\par \'93With Jander? Of course. Completely.\'94
\par \'93You never quarreled?\'94

\par But she was weeping and he waited, unable to say anything more, unable to think of a reasonable way to console her.
\par Finally, she shook her head and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. She whispered, \'93Is there anything more?\'94
\par Baley said apologetically, \'93A few questions on another subject and then I will be through annoying you.\'94 He added cautiously, \'93For now.\'94
\par \'93What is it?\'94 She seemed very tired.
\par \'93Do you know that there are people who seem to think that Dr. Fastolfe was responsible for the killing of Jander?\'94
\par \'93Yes.\'94
\par \'93Do you know that Dr. Fastolfe himself admits that only he possesses the expertise to kill Jander in the way that he was killed?\'94
\par \'93Yes. The dear doctor told me so himself.\'94
\par \'93Well, then, Gladia, do }{\i\fs20 you }{\fs20 think Dr. Fastolfe killed Jander?\'94 She looked up at him, suddenly and sharply, and then said angrily, \'93Of course not. Why should he? Jander was }{\i\fs20 his }{\fs20 
robot to begin with and he was full of care for him. You don\rquote t know the dear doctor as I do, Elijah. He is a gentle person who would hurt no one and who would never hurt a robot. To suppose he would kill one is to suppose that a rock wou

\par \'93I have no further questions, Gladia, and the only other busi\-ness I have here, at the moment, is to see Jander\emdash what remains of Jander\emdash if I have your permission.\'94

Baley followed Gladia through several rooms, the walls of which glowed dully. On one or two occasions, he caught a hint of movement, which he took to be a robot getting rapidly out of the way, since t~ley had been told not to intrude.
\par Through a hallway, then, and up a short ffight of stairs into a small room in which one part of one wall gleamed to give the effect of a spotlight.
\par The room held a cot and a chair\emdash and no other furnishings.
\par \'93This was his room,\'94 said Gladia. Then, as though answering Baley\rquote s thought, she went on to say, \'93It was all he needed. I left him alone as much as I could\emdash all day if I could. I did not want to ever grow tired of him.\'94
 She shook her head. \'93I wish now I had stayed with him every second. I didn\rquote t know our time would be so short. \emdash Here he is.\'94
\par Jander was lying on the cot and Baley looked at him gravely. The robot was covered with a smooth and shiny material. The spotlighted wall cast its glow on Jander\rquote s head, which was smooth and almost inhuman in its serenity. The eyes were wid
e open, but they were opaque and lusterless. He looked enough like Daneel to give ample point to Gladia\rquote s discomfort at Daneel\rquote s presence. His neck and bare shoulders showed above the sheet.
\par Baley said, \'93Has Dr. Fastolfe inspected him?\'94
\par \'93Yes, thoroughly. I came to him in despair and, if you had seen him rush here, the concern he felt, the pain, the\emdash the panic, you would never think he could have been responsible. There was nothing he could do.\'94
\par \'93Is he unclothed?\'94
\par \'93Yes. Dr. Fastolfe had to remove the clothing for a thorough examination. There was no point in replacing them.\'94
\par \'93Would you permit me to remove the covering, Gladia?\'94

\par \'93I do not wish to be blamed for having missed some obvious point of examination.\'94
\par \'93What can you possibly find that Dr. Fastolfe didn\rquote t?\'94
\par \'93Nothing, Gladia, but I must }{\i\fs20 know }{\fs20 that there is nothing for me to find. Please cooperate.\'94
\par \'93Well, then, go ahead, but }{\i\fs20 please }{\fs20 put the covering back ex\-actly as it is now when you are done.\'94
\par She turned her back on him and on Jander, put her left arm against the wall, and rested her forehead on it. There was no sound from her\emdash no motion_-but Baley knew that she was weep\-ing again.
\par The body was, perhaps, not quite human. The muscular con\-tours were somehow simplified and a bit schematic, but all the parts were there: nipples, navel, penis, testicles, pubic hair, and so on. Even fine, light hair on the chest.
\par How many days was it since Jander had been killed? It struck Baley that he didn\rquote t know, but it had been sometime before his trip to Aurora had begun. Over a week had passed and there was no sign of decay, either visually or olfactorily. A clear ro
\-botic difference.
\par Baley hesitated and then thrust one arm under Jander\rquote s shoul\-ders and another under his hips, working them through to the other side. He did not consider asking for Gladia\rquote s help\emdash 
that would be impossible. He heaved and, with some di~culty, turned Jander over without throwing him off the cot.
\par The cot creaked. Gladlia must know what he was doing, but she did not turn around. Though she did not offer to help, she did not protest either.
\par Baley withdrew his arms. Jander felt warm to the touch. Presumably, the power unit continued to do so simple a thing 
as to maintain temperature, even with the brain inoperative. The body felt firm and resilient, too. Presumably, it never went through any stage analogous to rigor morris.
\par One arm was now dangling off the cot in quite a human fash\-ion. Baley moved it gently
 and released it. It swung to and fro slightly and came to a halt. He bent one leg at the knee and studied the foot, then the other. The buttocks were perfectly formed and there was even an anus.

\fs20 Baley could not get rid of the feeling of uneasiness. The no\-tion that he was violating the privacy of a human being would not go away. If it were a human corpse, its coldness and its stiffness would have deprived it of humanity.
\par He thought uncomfortably: A robot corpse is much more human than a human corpse.
\par Again he reached under Jander, lifted, and turned him over. He smoothed out the sheet as best he could, then replaced the cover as it had been and smoothed that. He stepped back and decided it was as it had been at first\emdash or as near to that
 as he could manage.
\par \'93I\rquote m finished, Gladia,\'94 he said.
\par She turned, looked at Jander with wet eyes, and said, \'93May we go, then?\'94
\par \'93Yes, of course, but Gladia\emdash \'94
\par \'93Well?\'94
\par \'93Will you be keeping him this way? I imagine he won\rquote t decay.\'94
\par \'93Does it matter if I do?\'94
\par \'93In some ways, yes. You must give yourself a chance to recover. You can\rquote t spend three centuries mourning. What is over is over.\'94 (His statements sounded hollowly sententious in his own ear. What must they have sounded like in hers?)
\par She said, \'93I know you mean it kindly, Elijah. I have been requested to keep Jander till the investigation is done. He will then be torched at my request.\'94
\par \'93Torched?\'94
\par \'93Put under a plasma torch and reduced to his elements, as human corpses are. I wifi have holograms of him\emdash and memo\-ries. Will that satisfy you?\'94
\par \'93Of course. I must return to Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s house now.\'94
\par \'93Yes. Have you learned anything from Jander\rquote s body?\'94
\par \'93I did not expect to, Gladia.\'94

\par \'93Jehoshaphat,\'94 he murmured. Clearly, Aurora\rquote s sun, cooler and more orange than Earth\rquote s sun, accentuated the difference at set\-ting, when its light passed through a greater thickness of Aurora.

\par Daneel\rquote s voice was in his ear. \'93Are you well, Partner Elijah?\'94

Would you prefer to wait, sir? Would the darkness suit you bet\-ter? We ourselves will not be discommoded.\'94
\par Baley became aware of other robots, farther off, on every side. Had Gladia marked off her field robots for guard duty or had Fastolfe sent his?
\par It accentuated the way they were all caring for him and, per\-versely, he would not admit to weakness. He said, \'93No, we\rquote ll go now,\'94 and struck off at a brisk walk toward Fastolfe\rquote s estab\-
lishment, which he could just see through the distant trees.
\par Let the robots follow or not, as they wished, he thought boldly. He knew that, if he let himself think about it, there would be something within him that would still quail at the thought of himself on the outer skin of a planet with no protec\-

\par \'93And could you tell them apart, too, Giskard?\'94 They were closer to him now, perhaps because the other robots had taken over the long-distance duties.

\par \'93Did he do his work well, for instance?\'94
\par \'93Certainly.\'94
\par \'93Was he satisfactory in every way?\'94
\par \'93In every way, to my knowledge.\'94
\par \'93How about you, Giskard? What is your opinion?\'94
\par Giskard said, \'93I was never as close to friend Jander as friend Daneel was and it would not be proper for me to state an opin\-ion. I can say that, to my knowledge, Dr. Fastolfe was uni\-
formly pleased with friend Jander. He seemed equally pleased with friend Jander and with friend Daneel. However, I do not think my programming is such as to allow me to offer certainty in such matters.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93What about the period after Jander entered the household of Miss Gladia? Did you know him then, Daneel?\'94
\par \'93No, Partner Elijah. Miss Gladia kept him at her estab\-lishment. On those occasions when she visited Dr. Fastolfe, he was never with her, as far as I was aware. On occasions when I accompanied Dr. Fastolfe on a visit to Miss Gladia\rquote s estab\-
lishment, I did not see friend Jander.\'94
\par Baley felt a little surprised at that. He turned to Giskard in order to ask the same question, paused, and then shrugged. He was not really getting anywhere and, as Dr. Fastolfe had in\-dicated earlier, there is not really much use in cros
s-examining a robot. They would not knowingly say anything that would harm a human being, nor could they be badgered, bribed, or cajoled into it. They would not openly lie, but they would remain stub\-bornly\emdash if politely\emdash 
insistent on giving useless answers.
\par And\emdash perhaps\emdash it no longer mattered.
\par They were at Fastolfe\rquote s doorstep now and Baley felt his breath quickening. The trembling of his arms and lower lip, he was confident, was, indeed, only because of the cool wind.

astolfe merely smiled politely, in a way that signaled neither surprise, elation, nor disbelief. He led the way into what was ob\-viously a dining room, a smaller and friendlier one than the one in which they had had lunch.
\par \'93You and I, my dear Mr. Baley,\'94 said Fastolfe pleasantly, \'93will eat an informal dinner alone. Merely the two of us. We will even have the robots absent if that will please you. Nor shall we talk business unless you desperately want to.\'94
\par Baley said nothing, but paused to look at the walls in as\-
tonishment. They were a wavering, luminous green, with differences in brightness and in tint that were slowly progressive from bottom to top. There was a hint of fronds of deeper green and shadowy flickers this way and that. The walls made the room a
ppear to be a well-lit grotto at the bottom of a shallow arm of the sea. The effect was vertiginous\emdash at least, Baley found it so.

\par As was to be expected, the robot was silent and his motions were flawless. His handsome livery seemed to be out of histor\-

\fs20 Fastolfe fell into a kind of rumination and Baley said gently, \'93And what has all this to do with Gladia?\'94
\par Fastolfe started. \'93Oh! I had forgotten. Well, it\rquote s rather simple. Everthing I\rquote ve said about Gladia is true. I liked her. I sympa\-
thized with her. I admired her talent. But, in addition, she resembles Vasiia. I noticed the similarity when I saw the first hyperwave account of her arrival from Solaria. It was quite startling and it made me take an interest.\'94 He sighed. \'93
When I realized that she, like Vasilia, had been sex-scarred, it was more than I could endure. I arranged to have her established near me, as you see. I have been her friend and done my best to cushion the difficulties of adapting to a strange world.\'94

\par \'93She is a daughter-substitute, then.\'94
\par \'93After a fashion, yes, I suppose you could call it that, Mr. Baley. \emdash And you have no idea how glad I am she never took it~ into her head to offer herself to me. To have rejected her would have
 been to relive my rejection of Vasilia. To have accepted her out of an inability to repeat the rejection would have embit\-tered my life, for then I would have felt that I was doing for this stranger\emdash this faint reflection of my daughter\emdash 
what I would not do for my daughter herself. Either way\emdash  But, never mind, you can see now why I hesitated to answer you at first. Somehow, thinking about it led my mind back to this tragedy in my life.\'94
\par \'93And your other daughter?\'94
\par \'93Lumen?\'94 said Fastolfe indifferently. \'93I never had any contact with her, though I hear of her from time to time.\'94

s hand picked up a light and transparent ornament that had been resting on the dining room table. It turned it over and over, over and over. Except for that motion, Fastolfe seemed frozen. Finally, he said, \'93
That might be so, Mr. Baley. Certainly, after I loaned her Jander\emdash it was never an outright gift, incidentally\emdash I was less concerned about her offering her\-self to me.\'94

Do you remember the story you told me earlier today of the legendary mind-reading robot who was driven into stasis by that robotics pioneer?\'94
\par \'93By Susan Calvin, yes. I see! You model your scenario on that old legend. Very ingenious, Mr. Baley, but it won\rquote t work.\'94
\par \'93Why not? When you said only you could bring about a men\-tal freeze-out in Jander, you did not have the faintest idea that he was involved so deeply in so unexpected a situation. It runs exactly parallel to the Susan Calvin situation.\'94
\par \'93Let\rquote s suppose that the story about Susan Calvin and the mind-reading robot is not merely a totally fictitious legend. Let\rquote 
s take it seriously. There would still be no parallel between that story and the Jander situation. In the case of Susan Calvin, we would be dealing with an incredibly p
rimitive robot, one that today would not even achieve the status of a toy. It could deal only qualitatively with such matters: A creates misery; not-A creates misery; therefore mental freeze-out.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93And Jander?\'94
\par \'93Any modern robot\emdash any robot of the last century\emdash would weigh such matters quantitatively. Which of the two situations, A or not-A, would create the }{\i\fs20 most }{\fs20 
misery? The robot would come to a rapid decision and opt for minimum misery. The chance that he would judge the two mutually exclusive alterna\-
tives to produce precisely equal quantities of misery is small and, even if that should turn out to be the case, the modern robot is supplied with a randomization factor. If A and not-A are precisely equal misery-producers according to his judgment, 
he chooses one or the other in a completely unpredictable way and then follows that unquestioningly. He does }{\i\fs20 not }{\fs20 go into men\-tal freeze-out.\'94
\par \'93Are you saying it is impossible for Jander to go into mental freeze-out? You have been saying }{\i\fs20 you }{\fs20 could have produced }{\fs20 it.\'94
\par }{\fs20 \'93In the case of the humaniforin positronic brain, there is a way of sidetracking the randomization factor that depends en\-tirely on the way in which that brain is constructed. Even if you know the basic theory, }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 
is a very difficult and long-sus
tained process to so lead the robot down the garden path, so to speak, by a skillful succession of questions and orders as to finally induce the mental freeze-out. It is unthinkable that it be done by accident and the mere existence of all apparent contra
diction as that produced by simultaneous love and shame could not do the trick without the most careful quantitative adjustment under the most unusual }{\fs20 conditions, }{\fs20 ~\emdash \lquote 
vVhich leaves us, as I keep saying, with indeterministic chance as the only possible way in which it happened.\'94
\par \'93But your enemies will insist that your own guilt is the more likely. \emdash Could we not, in our turn, insist that Jander was brought to mental freeze-out by the conflict brought on by Gladia\rquote s love and shame? Would this not sound plausible
? And would }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 not win public opinion to your side?\'94
\par Fastolfe frowned. \'93Mr. Baley, you are too eager. Think about it seriously. If we were to try to get out of our dilemma in this rather dishonest fashion, what would be the consequence? I say nothing of the shame and misery }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 
would bring to Gladia, who would suffer not only the loss of Jander but the feeling that she herself had brought about that loss if, in fact, she had really felt and had somehow revealed her shame. I would not want to do that, but let
 us put that to one side, if we can. Consider, instead, that my enemies would say that I had loaned her Jander pre\-
cisely to bring about what had happened. I would have done it, they would say, in order to develop a method for mental freeze-out in humaniform robots while escaping all apparent respon\-sibility myself. }{\fs20 We }{\fs20 would be worse off than we }{

\par \'93It will feel warmer when you are under the cover with the light out, Partner Elijah.\'94
\par \'93Ah.\'94 He looked about suspiciously. \'93Would you put the light out, Daneel, and remain in the room when you have done so?\'94
\par The light went out almost at once and Baley realized that his supposition that this room, at least, was undecorated was totally wrong. As soon as it was dark, he felt he was Outside. There was the soft sound of wind in trees and the small, slee
py mutters of distant life-forms. There was also the ifiusion of stars overhead, with an occasional drifting cloud that was just barely visible.
\par \'93Put the light back on, Daneel!\'94
\par The room flooded with light.
\par \'93Daneel,\'94 said Baley. \'93I don\rquote t want any of that. I want no stars, no clouds, no sounds, no trees, no wind\emdash no scents, either. I want darkness\emdash featureless darkness. Could you arrange that?\'94

\par Baley turned in the indicated direction. He saw no break in the wall, but the floor molding in that spot did show a thicken\-ing as though it were a threshold.
\par \'93How do I see it in the dark, Daneel?\'94 he asked.

\par Half an hour later, he was through with the Personal and found himself huddling beneath the blanket, with the light out, enveloped by a warm spirit-hugging darkness.
\par As Fastolfe had said, it had been a long day. It was almost un\-believable that it had been only that morning that he had ar\-rived on Aurora. He had learned a great deal and yet none of it had done him any good.
\par He lay in the dark and went over the events of the day in quiet succession, hoping that something might occur to him that had eluded him before\emdash but nothing like that happened.
\par So much for the quietly thoughtful, keen-eyed, subtle-brained Elijah Baley of the hyperwave drama.

\par There was no point in }{\fs20 frying, }{\fs20 with his worn, sleep-seeking mind, to go over the day again, but he could not help trying a second time, following his own footsteps on this, his first day on Aurora\emdash from the spaceport to Fastolfe

Baley woke with a start and drew in his breath with sharp suspicion. There was a faint and unrecognizable odor in the air that vanished by his second breath.
\par Daneel stood gravely at the side of the bed. He said, \'93I trust, Partner Elijah, that you have slept well.\'94

\par Giskard began stripping the bed at once. \'93May I have your pajamas, sir?\'94
\par Baley hesitated for a moment only. It }{\fs20 was }{\fs20 a robot who asked, nothing more. He disrobed and handed the garment to Giskard, who took }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 with a small, grave nod of acceptance.
\par Baley looked at himself with distaste. He was suddenly con\-scious of a middle-aged body that was very likely in less good condition than Fastolfe\rquote s, which was nearly three times as old.
\par Automatically, he looked for his slippers and found there were none. Presumably, he needed none. The floor seemed warm and soft to his feet.
\par He stepped into the Personal and called out for instructions. From the other side of the illusory section of the wall, Giskard solemnly explained the working of the shaver, of the toothpaste dispenser, explained how to put the flushing device on auto\-
matic, how to control the temperature of the shower.
\par Everything was on a grander and more elaborate scale than anything Earth had to offer and there were no partitions on the other side of which he could hear the movements and involun\-tary sounds of someone else, something he had to ignore rig
idly to maintain the illusion of privacy.
\par It was effete, thought Baley somberly as he went through the luxurious ritual, but }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 was an effeteness that (he already knew) he could become accustomed to. If he stayed here on Aurora any length of time, he would
 find the culture shock of returning to Earth painfully intense, }{\i\fs20 particularly }{\fs20 with respect to the Per\-
sonal. He hoped that the readjustment would not take long, but he also hoped that any Earthpeople who settled new worlds would not feel impelled to cling to the concept of Community Personals.
\par Perhaps, thought Baley, that was how one ought to define \'93effete\'94: That to which one can become easily accustomed.
\par Baley stepped out of the Personal, various functions com\-pleted, chin new-cropped, teeth glistening, body showered and dry. He said, \'93Ciskard, where do I find the deodorant?\'94

\fs20 Giskard said, \'93I do not understand, sir.\'94
\par Daneel said quickly, \'93When you activated the lathering con\-trol, Partner Elijah, that introduced a deodorant effect. I ask pardon for friend Giskard\rquote s failure to understand. He lacks my experience on Earth.\'94
\par Baley lifted his eyebrows dubiously and began to dress with Giskard\rquote s help.
\par He said, \'93I see that you and Giskard are still with me every step of the way. Has there been any sign of any attempt at put\-ting me out of the way?\'94
\par Daneel said, \'93None thus far, Partner Elijah. Nevertheless, }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 would be wise to have friend Giskard and myself with you at all times, if that can possibly be managed.\'94
\par \'93Why is that, Daneel?\'94
\par \'93For two
 reasons, Partner Elijah. First, we can help you with any aspect of Auroran culture or folkways with which you are unfamiliar. Second, friend Giskard, in particular, can record and reproduce every word of every conversation you may have. This may be of va
lue to you. You will recall that there were times in your conversations with both Dr. Fastolfe and with Miss Gladia when friend Giskard and I were at a distance or in another room\emdash \'94
\par \'93So that conversations were not recorded by Giskard?\'94
\par \'93Actually, they were, Partner Elijah, but with low fidelity\emdash and there may be portions that will not be as clear as we would want them to be. It would be better if we stayed as close to you as is convenient.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93Daneel, are you of the opinion that I will be mor
e at ease if I think of you as guides and as recording devices, rather than as guards? Why not simply come to the conclusion that, as guards, you two are completely unnecessary. Since there have been no attempts at me so far, why isn\rquote 
t it possible to con\-clude that there will be no attempts at me in the future?\'94
\par \'93No, Partner Elijah, that would be incautious. Dr. Fastolfe feels that you are viewed with great apprehension by his ene\-mies. They had made attempts to persuade the Chairman not to give Dr. Fastolf
e permission to call you in and they will surely continue to attempt to persuade him to have you ordered back to Earth at the earliest possible moment.\'94

\par \'93No, sir, but if the opposition has reason to fear that you may exculpate Dr. Fastolf\'e9, }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 
is possible that they may feel driven to extremes. You are, after all, not an Auroran and the inhibitions against violence on our world would therefore be weakened in your case.\'94
\par Baley said dourly, \'93The fact that I\rquote ve been here a whole day and that nothing has happened should relieve their minds greatly and reduce the threat of violence considerably.\'94
\par \'93It would indeed seem so,\'94 said Daneel, showing no signs that he recognized the irony }{\fs20 in }{\fs20 Baley\rquote s voice.
\par \'93On the other hand,\'94 said Baley, \'93if I seem to make progress, then the danger to me immediately increases.\'94

\par \'93And, therefore, you and Giskard will come with me wherever I go, just in case I manage to do my job a little too well.\'94
\par Daneel paused again, then said, \'93Your way of putting }{\fs20 it, }{\fs20 Part\-ner Elijah, puzzles me, but you seem to be correct.\'94

 concerning the likelthood of your destroying a robot. Since she is a member of the Robotics Institute and on the side of your political enemies, any favorable evidence she may give would be persuasive.\'94

within touching distance. The present situation is too delicate and the difficulties too great for me to want to give up that additional effectiveness.\'94
\par \'93Well, I\rquote ll alert Gladia.\'94 He turned away, hesitated, and turned back. \'93But, Mr. Baley\emdash \'94
\par \'93Yes, Dr. Fastolfe?\'94

\par \'93I am not talking about Gladia now. I merely warn you that this essentially proper view of yours should be extended to my\-self. I don\rquote t expect you to worry about my convenience or pride if you should get a chance to talk to Vasilia. I don

\par }{\fs20 \'93To be perfectly honest, Dr. Fastolfe, }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 was never my atten\-tion to spare you. If I have to weigh your embarrassment or shame against the welfare of your policies and against the wel\-

any case, to become accustomed to the Outside. I am stating this as an order, Giskard.\'94
\par Daneel said softly, \'93Partner Elijah is quite correct in his request, friend Giskard. He will be reasonably safe.\'94
\par Giskard, perhaps reluctantly (Baley could not interpret the expression on his not-quite-human face), gave in and took his place at the controls. Baley followed and looked out of the clear glass of the windshield without quite the assurance he had

The car rose on its jets of compressed air and swayed a bit as though it were finding its footing. Baley felt a queasy sensation in the pit of his stomach and tried not to regret his brave perfor\-mance of mom
ents before. There was no use trying to tell him\-self that Daneel and Giskard showed no signs of fear and should be imitated. They were robots and could not feel fear.
\par And then the car moved forward suddenly and Baley felt him\-self pushed hard against the seat. Within a minute he was mov\-ing at as fast a speed as he had ever experienced on the Express\-ways of the City. A wide, grassy road stretched out ahead.
\par The speed seemed the greater for the fact that there were none of the friendly lights and structures of the City on either side but rather wide gulfs of greenery and irregular formations.
\par Baley fought to keep his breath steady and to talk as naturally as he might of neutral things.
\par He said, \'93We don\rquote t seem to be passing any farmland, Daneel. This seems to be unused land.\'94
\par Daneel said, \'93This is city territory, Partner Elijah. It is pri\-vately owned parkland and estates.\'94
\par \'93City?\'94 Baley could not accept the word. He knew what a City was.
\par \'93Eos is the largest and most important city on Aurora. The first to be established. The Auroran World Legislature sits here. The Chairman of the Legislature has his estate here and we will be passing it.\'94
\par Not only a city but the largest. Baley looked about to either side. \'93I was under the impression that the Fastolfe and Gladia establishments were on the outskirts of Eos. I should think we would have passed the city limits by now.\'94
\par \'93Not at all, Partner Elijah. We\rquote re passing through its center. The limits are seven kilometers away and our destination is nearly forty kilometers beyond that.\'94
\par \'93The center of the city? I see no structures.\'94
\par \'93They are not meant to be seen from the road, but there\rquote s one you can make out between the trees. That is the establishment of Fuad Labord, a well-known writer.\'94

\fs20 \'93They are in my memory banks,\'94 said Daneel solemnly.
\par \'93There\rquote s no traffic on the road. Why is that?\'94
\par \'93Long distances are covered by air-cars or magnetic subcars. Trimensional connections\emdash \'94
\par \'93They call it viewing on Solaria,\'94 said Baley.
\par \'93And here, too, in informal conversation, but TVC more for\-mally. That takes care of much communication. Finally, Aurorans are fond of walking and it is not unusual to walk sev\-eral kilometers for social visiti
ng or even for business meetings where time is not of the essence.\'94
\par \'93And we have to get somewhere that\rquote s too far to walk, too close for air-cars, and trimensional viewing is not wanted\emdash so we use a ground-car.\'94
\par \'93An airfoil, more specifically, Partner Elijah, but that qualifies as a ground-car, I suppose.\'94
\par \'93How long will it take to reach Vasilia\rquote s establishment?\'94
\par \'93Not long, Partner Elijah. She is at the Robotics Institute, as perhaps you know.\'94
\par There were some moments of silence and then Baley said, \'93It looks cloudy near the horizon there.\'94
\par Giskard negotiated a curve at high speed, the airfoil tipping through an angle of some thirty degrees. Baley choked back a moan and clung to Daneel, who flung his left arm about Baley\rquote s shoulders and held him in a strong vi
selike grip, one hand on each shoulder. Slowly, Baley let out his breath as the airfoil righted itself.
\par Daneel said, \'93Yes, those clouds will bring precipitation later in the day, as predicted.\'94
\par Baley frowned. He had been caught in the rain once\emdash once\emdash  durin
g his experimental work in the field Outside on Earth. It was like standing under a cold shower with his clothes on. There had been sheer panic for a moment when he realized that there was no way in which he could reach for any controls that would turn it
 off. The water would come down forever! \emdash Then every\-one was running and he ran with them, making for the dryness and controllability of the City.

Sir, we are in the parking lot of the Robotics Institute. We can now enter and visit the establishment that Dr. Vasilla maintains on the Institute grounds.\'94
\par Baley nodded. The trip had taken something between fifteen and twenty minutes (as nearly as he could judge, Earth time) and he was glad it was over. He said, rather breathlessly, \'93I want to know something about Dr. Fastolfe\rquote 
s daughter before I meet her. You did not know her, did you, Daneel?\'94
\par Daneel said, \'93At the time I came into existence, Dr. Fastolfe and his daughter had been separated for a considerable time. I have never met her.\'94
\par \'93But as for you, Giskard, you and she knew each other well. Is that not so?\'94
\par \'93It is so, sir,\'94 said Giskard impassively.
\par \'93And were fond of each other?\'94
\par \'93I believe, sir,\'94 said Giskard, \'93that it gave Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s daughter pleasure to be with me.\'94
\par \'93Did it give you pleasure to be with her?\'94
\par Giskard seemed to pick his words. \'93It gives me a sensation that I think is what human beings mean by \lquote pleasure\rquote  to be with any human being.\'94
\par \'93But more so with Vasilia, I think. Am I right?\'94
\par \'93Her pleasure at being with me, sir,\'94 said Giskard, \'93did seem to stimulate those positronic potentials that produce actions in me that are equivalent to those that pleasure produces in human beings. Or so I was once told by Dr. Fastolfe.\'94

\par Baley said suddenly, \'93Why did Vasilia leave her father?\'94
\par Giskard said nothing.
\par Baley said, with the sudden peremptoriness of an Earthman addressing a robot, \'93I asked you a question, boy.\'94
\par Giskard turned his head and stared at Baley, who, for a mo\-ment, thought the glow in the robot\rquote s eyes might be brightening into a blaze of resentment at the demeaning word.
\par However, Giskard spoke mildly and there was no readable ex\-pression in his eyes when he said, \'93I would like to answer, sir, but in all matters concerning that separation, Miss Vasilia or\-dered me at that time to say nothing.\'94

But I\rquote m ordering you to answer me and I can order you very firmly indeed\emdash if I wish to.\'94
\par Giskard said, \'93I am sorry. Miss Vasilia, even at that time, was skilled in robotics and the orders she gave me were sufficiently powerful to remain, despite anything you are likely to say, sir.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93She must have been skified in robotics, since Dr. Fastolfe told me she reprogrammed you on occasion.\'94
\par \'93It was not dangerous to do so, sir. Dr. Fastolfe himself could always correct any errors.\'94
\par \'93Did he have to?\'94
\par \'93He did not, sir.\'94
\par \'93What was the nature of the reprogramming?\'94
\par \'93Minor matters, sir.\'94
\par \'93Perhaps, but humor me. Just what was it she did?\'94
\par Giskard hesitated and Baley knew what that meant at once. The robot said, \'93I fear that any questions concerning the reprogramming cannot be answered by me.\'94
\par \'93You were forbidden?\'94
\par \'93No, sir, but the reprogramming automatically wipes out what went before. If I am changed in any particular, it would seem to me that I have always been as changed and I would have no memory of what I was before I was changed.\'94
\par \'93Then how do you know the reprogramming was minor?\'94
\par \'93Since Dr. Fastolfe never saw any need of correcting what Miss Vasiia did\emdash or so he once told me\emdash I can only suppose the changes were minor. You might ask Miss Vasilia, sir.\'94
\par \'93I will,\'94 said Baley.
\par \'93I fear, however, that she will not answer, sir.\'94
\par Baley\rquote s heart sank. So far he had questioned only Dr. Fastolfe, Gladia, and the two robots, all of whom had overriding reasons to cooperate. Now, for the first time, he would be facing an unfriendly subject.

\fs20 He looked around in surprise, for the structures were rather thickly spread, and to his right was a particularly large one, built plainly, rather like a huge right-angled block of metal and glass.
\par \'93Is that the Robotics Institute?\'94 he asked.
\par Daneel said, \'93This entire complex is the Institute, Partner Elijah. You are seeing only a portion and it is more thickly built up than is common on Aurora because it is a self-contained po\-
litical entity. It contains home establishments, laboratories, li\-braries, communal gymnasia, and so on. The large structure is the administrative center.\'94

\par Daneel said, \'93This is her establishment immediately before us.
\par \'93You have been instructed, then, as to its location?\'94
\par \'93That has been imprinted in our memory banks, Partner Elijah.\'94
\par \'93Well, then, lead the way.\'94
\par The orange sun was well up in the sky now and it was clearly nearing midday. As they approached Vasilia\rquote s establishment, they stepped into the shadow of the factory and Baley twitched a little as he felt the temperature drop immediately.
\par His lips tightened at the thought of occupying and setthng worlds without Cities, where the temperature was uncontrolled and subject to unpredictable, idiotic changes. \emdash And, he noted uneasily, the line of clouds at the horizon had advanced some\-

\par Giskard had walked into the establishment first and Daneel held out his arm to prevent Baley from following.
\par Of course! Giskard was reconnoitering.
\par So was Daneel, for that matter. His eyes traversed the land\-scape with an intentness no human being could have duplicated. Baley was ce

or an optic strip totally circumnavigating it. Daneel could not be expected to, of course, since he h

s arm exerted a respectful pressure and Baley moved forward. The door stood ajar.
\par There was no lock on Vasiia\rquote s establishment, but there had also been none (Baley suddenly remembered) on those of Gladia and of Dr. Fastolfe. A sparse population and separation helped insure privacy and, no doubt, the custom of noninter\-
ference helped, too. And, come to think of it, the ubiquitous robot guards were more efficient than any lock could be.
\par The pressure of Daneel\rquote s hand on Baley\rquote s upper arm brought the latter to a halt. Giskard, ahead of them, was speaking in a low voice to two robots, who were themselves rather Giskard\-like.
\par A sudden coldness struck the pit of Baley\rquote s stomach. What if some rapid maneuver substituted another robot for Giskard? Would he be able to recognize the substitution? Tell two such robots apart? Would he be left with a robot without special in\-
structions to guard him, one who might innocently lead him into danger and then react with insufficient quickness when protec\-tion was necessary?
\par Controlling his voice, he said calmly to Daneel, \'93Remarkable the similarity in those robots, Daneel. Can you tell them apart?\'94
\par \'93Certainly, Partner Elijah. Their clothing designs are different and their code numbers are different, as well.\'94

\par \'93Well, then, I would be in trouble if I had to do the identi\-fying, wouldn\rquote t I?\'94

Dr. Vasilia, I have no authority to question you; I have no legal means of forcing you to answer my questions. However, the death of Jander Panell has put your father in a position of some\emdash \'94
\par \'93It has put }{\i\fs20 whom }{\fs20 in a position?\'94
\par \'93Your father.\'94
\par \'93Earthman, I sometimes refer to a certain individual as my fa\-ther, but no one else does. Please use a proper name.\'94
\par \'93Dr. Han Fastolfe. He is your father, isn\rquote t he? As a matter of record?\'94
\par Vasilia said, \'93You are using a biological term. I share genes with him in a manner characteristic of what }{\i\fs20 on Earth }{\fs20 would be considered a father-daughter relationship. This is a
 matter of indifference on Aurora, except in medical and genetic matters. I can conceive of my suffering from certain metabolic states in which it would be appropriate to consider the physiology and biochemistry of those with whom I share genes\emdash 
parents, sib\-lings, children, and so on. Otherwise these relationships are not generally referred to in polite Auroran society. \emdash I explain this to you because you are an Earthman.\'94
\par \'93if I have offended against custom,\'94 said Baley, \'93it is through ignorance and I apologize. May I refer to the gentleman under discussion by name?\'94
\par \'93Certainly.\'94
\par \'93In that case, the death of Jander Panell has put Dr. Han Fas\-tolfe into a position of some difficulty and I would assume that you would be concerned enough to desire to help him.\'94
\par \'93You assume that, do you? Why?\'94
\par \'93He is your\emdash  He brought you up. He cared for you. You had a profound affection for each other. He still feels a profound affection for you.\'94

\par \'93It was obvious from the details of our conversations\emdash even from the fact that he has taken an interest in the Solarian woman, Cladia Delmarre, because of her resemblance to you.\'94

\fs20 \'93He did, but even if he hadn\rquote t, the resemblance is obvious.\'94
\par \'93Nevertheless, Earthman, I owe Dr. Fastolfe nothing. Your as\-sumptions can be dismissed.\'94
\par Baley cleared his throat. \'93Aside from any personal feelings you might or might not have, there is the matter of the future of the Galaxy. Dr. Fastolfe wishes new world
s to be explored and settled by human beings. If the political repercussions of Jander\rquote s death lead to the exploration and settlement of the new worlds by robots, Dr. Fastolfe believes that this will be cata\-
strophic for Aurora and humanity. Surely you would not be a party to such a catastrophe.\'94
\par Vastha said indifferently, watching him closely, \'93Surely not, if I agreed with Dr. Fastolfe. I do not. I see no harm in having humaniform robots doing the work. I am here at the Institute, in fact, to make that pos
sible. I am a Globalist. Since Dr. Fastolfe is a Humanist, he is my political enemy.\'94
\par Her answers were clipped and direct, no longer than they had to be. Each time there followed a definite silence, as though she were waiting, with interest, for the next q
uestion. Baley had the impression that she was curious about him, amused by him, making wagers with herself as to what the next question might be, determined to give him just the minimum information neces\-sary to force another question.
\par He said, \'93Have you long been a member of this Institute?\'94
\par \'93Since its formation.\'94
\par \'93Are there many members?\'94
\par \'93I should judge about a third of Aurora\rquote s roboticists are members, though only about half of these actually live and work on the Institute grounds.\'94
\par \'93Do other members of the Institute share your views on the robotic exploration of other worlds? Do they oppose Dr. Fas\-tolfe\rquote s views one and all?\'94
\par \'93I suspect that most of them are Globalists, but I don\rquote t know that we have taken a vote on the matter or even discussed it fQr\-mally. You had better ask them all individually.\'94
\par \'93Is Dr. Fastolfe a member of the Institute?\'94
\par \'93No.\'94

\par Baley nodded and said, \'93Eos is the ancient Greek goddess of the dawn, as Aurora is the ancient Roman goddess of the dawn.\'94
\par \'93Exactly. Dr. Han Fastolfe lives in the City of the Dawn on the World of the Dawn, but he is not himself a believer in the Dawn. He does not understand the necessary method of expan\-
sion through the Galaxy, of converting the Spacer Dawn into broad Galactic Day. The robotic exploration of the Galaxy is the only practical way to carry the task through and he won\rquote t accept it\emdash or us.\'94
\par Baley said slowly, \'93Why is it the only practical method? Aurora and the other Spacer worlds were not explored and set\-tled by robots but by human beings.\'94
\par \'93Correction. By Earthpeople. It was a wasteful and inefficient procedure and there are now no Earthpeople that we will allow to serve as further settlers. We have become Spacers, long-lived and healthy, and we have robots who are infinitely more versa
\-tile and flexible than those available to the human beings who originally settled our worlds. Times and matters are wholly different\emdash and }{\i\fs20 today }{\fs20 only robotic exploration is feasible.\'94
\par \'93Let us suppose you are right and Dr. Fastolfe is wrong. Even so, he has a logical view. Why won\rquote t he and the Institute accept each other? Simply because they disagree on this point?\'94
\par \'93No, this disagreement is comparatively minor. There is a more fundamental conflict.\'94

\par Baley spread his hands wide. \'93I congratulate you.\'94

\par \'93I was told this morning that, in three or four centuries, many, many losses have a chance to accumulate.\'94
\par \'93I\rquote m afraid so,\'94 said Vasiia. \'93And many, many gains have a chance to accumulate, as well. On the whole, it balances.\'94
\par \'93What, then, are the disadvantages?\'94
\par \'93You are not a scientist, of course.\'94
\par \'93I am a plainclothesman\emdash a policeman, if you like.\'94
\par \'93But perhaps you know scientists on your world.\'94
\par \'93I have met some,\'94 said Baley cautiously.
\par \'93You know how they work? We are told that on Earth they cooperate out of necessity. They have, at most, half a century of active labor in the course of their short lives. Less than seven metric decades. Not much can be done in that time.\'94
\par \'93Some of our scientists had accomplished quite a deal in con\-siderably less time.\'94
\par \'93Because they have taken advantage of the findings others have made before them and profit from the use they can make of contemporary findings by others. Isn\rquote t that so?\'94
\par \'93Of course. We have a scientific community to which all con\-tribute, across the expanse of space and of time.\'94

\par \'93In theory it is; in practice not so much. The pressures in a long-lived society are less. Scientists here have three or three and a half centuries to devote to a problem, so that the thought
 arises that significant progress may be made in that time by a solitary worker, It becomes possible to feel a kind of intellectual greed\emdash to }{\i\fs20 want }{\fs20 to accomplish something on your own, to as\-
sume a property right to a particular facet of progress, to be wiling to see the general advance slowed\emdash rather than give up what you conceive to be yours alone. And the general advance }{\i\fs20 is }{\fs20 
slowed on Spacer worlds as a result, to the point where it is difficult to outpace the work done on Earth, despite our enor\-mous advantages.\'94
\par \'93I assume you wouldn\rquote t say this if I were not to take it that Dr. Han Fastolfe behaves in this manner.\'94
\par \'93He certainly does. It is his theoretical analysis of the posi\-tronic brain that has made the humaniform robot possible. He has used it to construct\emdash with the help of the late Dr. Sarton\emdash 
 your robot friend Daneel, but he has not published the impor\-tant details of his theory, nor does he make it available to any\-one else. In this way, he\emdash and he alone\emdash holds a stranglehold on the production of hunianiform robots.\'94
\par Baley furrowed his brow. \'93And the Robotics Institute is dedicated to cooperation among scientists?\'94
\par \'93Exactly. This Institute is made up of over a hundred top\-notch roboticists of different ages, advancements, and skills and
 we hope to establish branches on other worlds and make it an interstellar association. All of us are dedicated to communicating our separate discoveries or speculations to the common fund\emdash 
 doing voluntarily for the general good what you Earthpeople do perforce because you live such short lives.
\par \'93This, however, Dr. Han Fastolfe will not do. I\rquote m sure you think of Dr. Han Fastolfe as a nobly idealistic Auroran patriot, but he will not put his intellectual property\emdash as he thinks of it\emdash  into the common fund and

I grow weary. You have told me that Gremionis was interested first in me, and then in my look-alike, the Solarian. And now you want me to deny it. Why should I take the trouble to deny it? Of what importance is it? Even if it were true, how could this dam
age me in any way? You are saying that I was annoyed by attentions I didn\rquote t want and that I ingeniously deflected them. Well?\'94
\par Baley said, \'93It is not so much what you did, as why. You knew that Gremionis was the type of person who would be persistent. He had offered himself to you over and over and he would offer himself to Gladia over and over.\'94
\par \'93If she would refuse him.\'94
\par \'93She was a Solarian, having trouble with sex, and was refusing everyone, something I dare say you knew, since I imagine that, for all your estrangement from your fa\emdash from Dr. Fastolfe, you have enough feeling to keep an eye on your replacement.
\'94
\par \'93Well, then, good for her. If she refused Gremionis, she showed good taste.\'94
\par \'93You knew there was no \lquote if\rquote  about it. You knew she would.\'94
\par \'93Still\emdash what of it?\'94
\par \'93Repeated offers to her would mean that Gremionis would be in Gladia\rquote s establishment frequently, that he would cling to her.\'94

\fs20 Vasiia hesitated. Then, \'93What are you driving at?\'94
\par \'93I think it struck you that if, somehow, the humaniform robot were killed under circumstances that would implicate Dr. Fas\-tolfe, that could be used as a weapon
 to force the secret of the humaniform positronic brain out of him. Gremionis, annoyed over Gladia\rquote s persistent refusal to accept him and given the op\-portunity by his constant presence at Gladia\rquote 
s establishment, could be induced to seek a fearful revenge by killing the robot.\'94
\par Vasilia blinked rapidly. \'93That poor barber might have twenty such motives and twenty such opportunities and it wouldn\rquote t mat\-ter. He wouldn\rquote t know how to order a robot to shake hands with any efficiency. How would he manage to come wi
thin a light\-year of imposing mental freeze-out on a robot?\'94
\par \'93Which now,\'94 said Baley softly, \'93finally brings us to the point, a point I think you have been anticipating, for you have some\-how restrained yourself from throwing me out because you had to make

\par Vasilia said, \'93I can, if necessary, summon twenty human beings from within the Institute who will put you out, perhaps }{\i\fs20 with }{\fs20 a little damage, and your robots, even Daneel, will not be able to interfere effectively.\'94

\par \'93When I was born, I should have been placed with others of my kind, with professionals who knew how to care for infants. I should not have been kept by myself in the charge of an ama\-teur\emdash

\par \'93He loved you,\'94 muttered Baley.
\par \'93Loved me? Any other infant would have done as well, but no other infant was available. What he wanted was a growing child in his presence, a developing brain. He wanted to make a care\-

mentation, with no consideration for me as a human being at all.\'94

\par \'93Oh, would he now?\'94 she said bitterly. \'93You don\rquote t know the force of indifference in a man like Dr. Fastolfe. If it would have advanced his knowledge to snuff out my life, he would have done so without hesitation.\'94

human being I really knew. He was superficially gentle to me and I didn\rquote t understand his true pur\-poses. He was a natural target for me. Then, too, he saw to it that I was introduced to sexual stimulation under controlled con\-ditions\emdash 
the controls }{\i\fs20 he }{\fs20 set up. It was inevitable that eventually I would turn to him. I had to, for there was no one else\emdash and he refused.\'94

for his purposes. He therefore gave her the robot, Jander, to see what would happen if a woman not raised on Aurora were faced with a robot that seeme
d human in every particular. He knew that an Auroran woman would very likely make use of the robot for sex immedi\-
ately and have no trouble doing so. I myself would have some trouble, I admit, because I was not brought up normally, but no ordinary Auroran 
would. The Solarian woman, on the other hand, would have a great deal of trouble because she was brought up on an extremely robotic world and had unusually rigid mental attitudes toward robots. The difference, you see, might be very instructive to my fath
er, who tried, out of these variations, to build his theory of brain functioning. Han Fastolfe waited half a year for the Solarian woman to get to the point where she could perhaps begin making the first experimental approaches\emdash \'94

going on; he had to, for it must have been part of his study of how a human brain was bent under Solarian conditions.
\par \'93And then he thought\emdash and I am as sure of this as I would be if I could read his thoughts\emdash what would happen now, at the point where the wom
an is just beginning to rely on Jander, if, suddenly, without reason, she lost him. He knew what an Auroran woman would do. She would feel some disappointment and then seek out some substitute, but what would a Solarian woman do? So he arranged to put Jan
der out of commission\emdash \'94

\fs20 Baley frowned. The lesser robot would naturally have the more rigid mind and Baley suddenly recognized the danger that he 
would simply nOt be allowed out of their sight and, therefore, not allowed to enter the Personal. He put a note of urgency into his voice and turned his attention to Daneel, who might be expected to more nearly understand human needs. \'93I can\rquote 
t help that, Giskard. \emdash Daneel, I have no choice in the matter. Let me out of the car.\'94
\par Giskard looked at Baley without moving and, for one horrid moment, Baley thought the robot would suggest that he unbur\-den himself in the nearby field\emdash in the open, like an animal.
\par The moment passed. Daneel said, \'93I think we must allow Part\-ner Elijah to have his way in this respect.\'94
\par Whereupon Giskard said to Baley, \'93If you can wait for a short while, sir, I will approach the structure first.\'94
\par Baley grimaced. Giskard walked slowly toward the building and then, deliberately, circumnavigated it. Baley might have predicted the fact that, once Giskard disappeared, his own sense of urgency would increase.
\par He tried to distract his own nerve endings by staring around at the prospect. After some study, he became aware of thin wires in the air, here and there\emdash 
fine, dark hairs against the white sky. He did not see them, to begin with. What he saw first was an oval object sliding along beneath the clouds. He became aware of it as a vehicle and real
ized that it was not floating but was suspended from a long horizontal wire. He followed that long wire with his eyes, forward and back, noting others of the sort. He then saw another vehicle farther off\emdash 
and yet another still farther off. The farthest of the three was a featureless speck whose nature he understood only because he had seen the nearer ones.
\par Undoubtedly, these were cable-cars for internal transportation from one part of the Robotics Institute to another.
\par How spread out it all was, thought Baley. How needlessly the Institute consumed space.
\par And yet, in doing so, it did not consume the surface. The structures were sufficiently widely spaced so that the greenery seemed untouched and the plant and animal life continued (Baley imagined) as they might in emptiness.

\fs20 Solaria, Baley remembered, had been empty. No doubt all the Spacer worlds were empty, since Aurora, the n~ost populous, was so empty, even here in the most built-up region of the planet. For that matter, even Earth\emdash outside the Cities\emdash 
was empty.
\par But there }{\i\fs20 were }{\fs20 the Cities and Baley felt a sharp pang of homesickness, which he had to push to one side.
\par Daneel said, \'93Ah, friend Giskard has completed his examina\-tion.\'94

\par Giskard said, \'93It seems quite certain that the Personal is unoc\-cupied.\'94
\par \'93Good! Then get out of my way.\'94 Baley flung open the door of the airfoil and stepped out onto the gravel of a narrow path. He strode rapidly, with Daneel following.
\par When he reached the door of the structure, Daneel wordlessly indicated the contact that would open it. Daneel did not venture to touch the contact himself. Presumably, thought Baley, to have done so without specific instructions would have indicated an in
\-tention to enter\emdash and even the intention was not permitted.
\par Baley pushed the contact and entered, leaving the two robots behind.
\par It was not until he was inside that it occurred to him that Giskard could not possibly have entered the Personal to see that it was unoccupied, that the robot must have been judging the matter from external appearance\emdash a dubious proceeding at best.

\par And Baley realized, with some discomfort, that, for the first time, he was isolated and separated from all protectors\emdash and that the protectors on the other side of the door couldn\rquote 
t easily enter if he were suddenly in trouble. What, then, if he were, at this moment, not alone? What if so
me enemy had been alerted by Vasilia, who knew he would be in search of a Personal, and what if that enemy was in hiding right now in the structure?

\par The voice came again. Impatient. \'93Come! You }{\i\fs20 must }{\fs20 be Elijah Baley.\'94
\par Slowly, Baley turned. It was a man of moderate height, deli\-cately dressed in well-fitted clothing in various shades of blue. He was light-skinned, light-haired, and had a 
small mustache that was a shade darker than the hair on his head. Baley found himself staring with fascination at the small strip of hair on the upper lip. It was the first time he had seen a Spacer with a mus\-tache.
\par Baley said (and was filled with shame at speaking in a Per\-sonal), \'93I am Elijah Baley.\'94 His voice, even in his own ears, seemed a scratchy and unconvincing whisper.
\par The Spacer seemed to find it unconvincing, certainly. He said, narrowing his eyes and staring, \'93The robots outside said Elijah Baley was in here, but you don\rquote t look at all the way you looked on hyperwave. Not at all.\'94
\par That foolish dramatization! thought Baley fiercely. No one would meet him to the end of time without having been prelimi\-narily poisoned by that impossible representation. No one would accept him as a human being at the start, as a fallible human be-

\par That was another source of grievance, apparently. \'93I nearly didn\rquote t,\'94 said the Spacer. \'93They tried to stop me and I only had one robot with me. I had to pretend I had to get in here on an emergency basis and they }{\i\fs20 searched }{\fs20

concerting than the fact of planet-wide indiscriminate use had been the horror of being openly and casually addressed\emdash of be\-havior that drew no distinction between this place and its pur\-pose and any other place and purpose.
\par The book-ifims he had viewed had said nothing of this. Clearly, as Fastolfe had pointed out, t
hey were not written for Earth-people but for Aurorans and, to a lesser extent, for possible tourists from the other forty-nine Spacer worlds. Earthpeople, after all, almost never went to the Spacer worlds, least of all to Aurora. They were not welcome th
ere. Why, then, should they be addressed?
\par And why should the book-films expand on what everyone knew? Should they make a fuss over the fact that Aurora was spherical in shape, or that water was wet, or that one man might address another freely in a Personal?

\par \'93That is so, Partner Elijah,\'94 said Daneel.
\par \'93I\rquote m glad to hear that,\'94 said Baley. \'93This person is Santirix Gremionis. Mr. Gremionis, this is Daneel and this is Giskard.\'94
\par Each robot bent his head solemnly. Gremionis merely glanced at them and lifted one hand in indifferent acknowledgment. He made no effort to introduce his own robot.
\par Baley 
looked around. The light was distinctly dimmer, the wind was brisker, the air was cooler, the sun was completely hidden by clouds. There was a gloom to the surroundings that did not seem to affect Baley, who continued to be delighted at having escaped fro
m the Personal. It lifted his spirits amazingly that he was actually experiencing the feeling of being pleased at being Outside. It was a special case, he knew, but it was a begin\-ning and he could not help but consider it a triumph.
\par Baley was about to turn to Gremionis to resume the conver\-sation, when his eye caught movement. Walking across the lawn came a woman with an accompanying robot. She was coming to\-
ward them but seemed totally oblivious to them. She was clearly making for the Personal.

\par \'93What?\'94 said Gremionis.

\par Baley turned away. It had not been many minutes before that he had thought that open conversation in a Personal was the acme in bad taste, of Things Not Done.
\par If he had tried to think of something worse yet, he would have completely failed to dredge up the possibility of encounter\-ing a woman in a Personal. Convention on Earth required him to ignore the presence of others in the large Community Per\-
sonals on that world, but not all the conventions ever invented would have prevented him from knowing whether a person pass\-ing him was a man or a woman.
\par What if, while he had been in the Personal, a woman had en\-tered\emdash casually, indifferently\emdash as this one had just done? Or, worse still, what if he had entered a Personal and found a woman already there?
\par He could not estimate his reaction. He had never weighed the possibility, let alone met with such a situation, but he found the thought totally intolerable.
\par And the book-films had told him nothing about that, either.
\par He had viewed those ifims in order that he might not ap\-proach the investigation in total ignorance of the Auroran way of life\emdash and they had left him in total ignorance of all that was important.
\par Then how could he handle this triply knotted puzzle of Jander\rquote s death, when at every step he found himself lost in igno\-rance?
\par A moment before he had felt triumph at a small conquest over the terrors of Outside, but now he was faced with the feeling of being ignorant of everything, ignorant even of the nature of his ignorance.
\par It was now, while fighting not to picture the woman passing through the airspace lately occupied by himself, that he came near to utter despair.

\par He walked rapidly toward the airfoil that was resting in the open stretch beyond the gravel path. On the other side was a small two-wheeled vehicle, with two seats, one behind the other. Baley assumed it to be Gremionis\rquote  scooter.
\par His feeling of depression and misery, Baley realized, was ac\-centuated by the fact that he felt hungry. It was clearly past lunchtime and he had not eaten.
\par He turned to Gremionis. \'93Let\rquote s talk\emdash but if you don\rquote t mind, let\rquote s do it over lunch. That is, if you haven\rquote t already eaten\emdash and if you don\rquote t mind eating with me.\'94

\par \'93Is there an alternative?\'94
\par \'93Come to my establishment,\'94 said Gremionis at once. \'93It isn\rquote t one of the fancier ones here. I\rquote m not one of your high executives. Still, I have a few serviceable robots and we can set a decent table. \emdash I tell you what. I

\par He moved away at an eager half-run. Baley watched him and thought there seemed to be a kind of gangly youthfulness about him. There was no easy way of actually judging his age, of course; Spacers didn\rquote 
t show age and Gremionis might easily be fifty. But he }{\i\fs20 acted }{\fs20 young, almost what an Earthman would con\-sider teenage young. Bale>\rquote  wasn\rquote t sure exactly what there was about him that gave that impression.

\fs20 Baley turned suddenly to Daneel. \'93Do you know Gremionis, Daneel?\'94
\par \'93I have never met him before, Partner Elijah.\'94
\par \'93You, Giskard?\'94
\par \'93I have met him once, sir, but only in passing.\'94
\par \'93Do you know anything about him, Giskard?\'94
\par \'93Nothing that is not apparent on the surface, sir.\'94
\par \'93His age? His personality?\'94
\par \'93No, sir.\'94
\par Gremionis shouted, \'93Ready?\'94 His scooter was humming rather roughly. It was clear that it was not air-jet assisted. The wheels would not leave the ground. Brundij sat behind Gremionis.
\par Giskard, Daneel, and Baley moved quickly into their airfoil once again.
\par Gremionis moved outward in a loose circle. Gremionis\rquote  hair flew backward in the wind and Baley had a sudden sens
ation of how the wind must feel when one traveled in an open vehicle such as a scooter. He was thankful he was totally enclosed in an airfoil\emdash which suddenly seemed to him a much more civilized way of traveling.
\par The scooter straightened out and darted off with a muted roar, Gremionis waving one hand in a follow-me gesture. The robot behind him maintained his balance with almost negligent ease and did not hold on to Gremionis\rquote  waist, as Baley was cer\-
tain a human being would have needed to.
\par The airfoil followed. Although the scooter\rquote s smooth forward progression seemed high-speed, that was apparently the illusion of its small size. The airfoil had some difficulty maintaining a speed low enough to avoid running it down.
\par \'93Just the same,\'94 said Baley thoughtfully, \'93one thing puzzles me.
\par \'93What is that, Partner Elijah?\'94 asked Daneel.
\par \'93Vasilia referred to this Gremionis disparagingly as a \lquote barber.\rquote  Apparently, he deals with hair, clothes, and other matters of per\-sonal human adornment. How is it, then, that he has an estab\-

It took only a few minutes before Baley found himself in the fourth Auroran establishment he had seen since his arrival on the planet a day and a half before: Fastolfe\rquote s, Gladia\rquote s, Vasilia\rquote s, and now Gremionis\rquote .
\par Gremionis\rquote  establishment appeared smaller and drabber than the others, even though it showed, to Baley\rquote s unpracticed eye in Auroran matters, signs of recent construction. The distinctive mark of the Auroran establishment\emdash 
the robotic niches\emdash were, however, present. On entering, Giskard and Daneel moved quickly into two that were empty and faced the room, unmoving and silent. Gremionis\rquote  robot, Brundij, moved into a third niche almost as quickly.
\par There was no sign of any difficulty in making their choices or of any tendency for any one niche to be the target of two robots, however briefly. Baley wondered how the robots avoided conflict and decided there must be signal communication amo
ng them of a kind that was subliminal to human beings. It was something (provided he remembered to do so) concerning which he might consult Daneel.
\par Gremionis was studying the niches also, Baley noticed.

\par \'93Was it on her recommendation, then, that you received your present position as\emdash might we say\emdash official personnel artist for the members of the Robotics Institute?\'94
\par \'93She recognized my qualifications. I was tested, along with others, and won the position on my merits.\'94

\par Briefly and with annoyance, Gremionis said, \'93Yes.\'94
\par \'93And you felt the only decent return you could make was to offer yourself to her.\'94
\par Gremionis grimaced and drew his tongue across his lips, as though tasting something unpleasant. \'93That\emdash is\emdash disgusting! I suppose an Earthman would think in such a way. My offer meant only that it pleased me to do so.\'94
\par \'93Because she is attractive and has a warm personality?\'94 Cremionis hesitated. \'93Well, I wouldn\rquote t say she has a warm personality,\'94 he said cautiously, \'93but certainly she\rquote s attractive.\'94
\par \'93I\rquote ve been told that you offer yourself to everybody\emdash without distinction.\'94

\par \'93That I offer myself to everybody. Who said that?\'94
\par \'93I don\rquote t know that }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 would serve any purpose to answer that question. Would you expect me to quote you as a source of em\-barrassing information? Would you speak freely to me if you thought I would?\'94
\par \lquote Well, whoever said it is a liar.\'94
\par \'93Perhaps }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 was merely dramatic exaggeration. Had you offered yourself to others before you offered yourself to Dr. Vasiia?\'94
\par Gremionis looked away. \'93Once or twice. Never seriously.\'94
\par \'93But Dr. Vasiia was someone you were serious about?\'94
\par \'93Well\emdash \'94
\par \'93It is my understanding you offered yourself to her repeatedly, which is quite against Aurorari custom.\'94
\par \'93Oh, Auroran custom\emdash \'94 Gremionis began furiously. Then he pressed his lips together firmly and his forehead furrowed. \'93See here, Mr. Baley, can I speak to you confidentially?\'94
\par \'93Yes. All my questions are intended to satisfy myself that you had nothing to do with Jander\rquote s death. Once I am satisfied of that, you may be sure I\rquote ll keep your remarks in confidence.\'94

\par \'93Well, I came in limping one day and creaking at the thighs, so I had to explain. She laughed and said it was a good idea and the best way to get a walker to accept an offer was to walk with them. \lquote Keep it up,\rquote  she said, \lquote and she

\par \'93Of course, Mr. Gremionis,\'94 said Daneel with what was almost suavity.

hing was still rapid and his hair was, to a small extent, in disarray.
\par Baley now stood, one hand on the back of the chair on which he had been sitting.
\par Gremionis said, \'93I am sorry, Mr. Baley, for losing control. It is something I have not done in my adult

\par \'93Kelden Amadiro.\'94
\par \'93And would there be some way of reaching him from here?\'94 Gremionis said, \'93Well, yes and no. You can reach his recep\-tionist or his assistant. I doubt that you\rquote ll reach him. He\rquote s a rather standoffish person, I\rquote m told. I don

\par The room with the trimensic outlet 
was quite empty, except for a thin pillar toward one side of the room. It ended waist-high in a flat surface on which there was a rather complicated console. The pillar stood in the center of a circle marked off on the light green floor in a neutral gray.
 Near it was an identical circle in size and color, but on the second one there stood no pil\-lar.
\par Daneel stepped to the pillar and, as he did so, the circle on which it stood glowed with a faint white radiance. His hand moved over the console, his fingers f
licking too quickly for Baley to make out clearly what it was they did. It only took a second and then the other circle glowed in precisely the same way. A robot appeared on it, three-dimensional in appearance but with a very faint fficker that gave away 
the fact that it was a holographic image. Next to him was a console like that next to which Daneel stood, but the robot\rquote s console also ffickered and was also an image.

\par \'93Are you accusing the Master Roboticist of having had any\-thing to do with this Jander Panell business?\'94
\par \'93On the contrary, Roboticist. It is because I }{\i\fs20 don\rquote t }{\fs20 want to ac\-cuse him that I must see him. I would hate to imply any connec\-

\par Cicis reddened. \'93You wouldn\rquote t }{\i\fs20 dare }{\fs20 say anything of the sort.\'94
\par \'93Wouldn\rquote t I? What would I have to lose? On the other hand, how will it sound to the general public? After all, Aurorans are perfectly aware that Dr. Amadiro is second only to Dr.

Then, if he explains just a few minor points, we can avoid all question of slander or accusation or anything of the sort.\'94
\par Cicis scowled and said stiffly, \'93I will tell Dr. Amadiro this and I will strongly advise him to refuse to see you.\'94 He disappeared.
\par Again, Baley waited patiently, while Gremionis gestured fiercely and said in a loud whisper, \'93You can\rquote t do that, Baley. You can\rquote t do it.\'94 Baley waved him quiet.

\fs20 Daneel said, \'93Partner Elijah, I fear that Mr. Gremionis is justified in his alarm. The Auroran World Legislature cannot do more than evict you, since you are not an Auroran citizen. Nev\-
ertheless, they can insist that the Earth authorities punish you se\-verely and Earth will do so. They could not resist an Auroran demand, in this case. I would not wish you to be punished in this way, Partner Elijah.\'94
\par Baley said heavily, \'93Nor do I wish the punishment, Daneel, but I must take the chance. \emdash 
Mr. Gremionis, I am sorry that I had to tell him I was calling from your establishment. I had to do something to persuade him to see me and I felt he might at\-tach importance to that fact. What I said was, after all, the truth.\'94
\par Gremionis shook his head. \'93If I had known what you were going to do, Mr. Baley, I would not have permitted you to call from my establishment. I feel sure that I\rquote m going to lose my po\-sition here and\'94\emdash with bitterness\emdash \'94

\par Baley lifted his hand in farewell. \'93Good-bye, Mr. Gremioriis. Thank you again. Don\rquote t worry and\emdash remember what I said about Gladia.\'94

\par \'93The sun has set. I wouldn\rquote t have thought it.\'94
\par \'93The sun has not yet set, sir,\'94 put in Giskard. \'93It is about two hours before sunset.\'94
\par Daneel said, \'93It is the gathering storm, Partner Elijah. The clouds are thickening, but the storm will not actually break for some time yet.\'94
\par Baley shivered. Dark, in itself, did not disturb him. In fact, when Outside, night, with its suggestion of enclosing walls, was far more soothing than the day, which broadened the horizons and opened space in every direction.
\par The trouble was that this was neither day nor night.
\par Again, he tried to remember what it had been like that time it had rained when he had been Outside.
\par It suddenly occurred to him that he had never been out when it snowed and that he wasn\rquote t even sure what the rain of crys\-
talline solid water was like. Descriptions in words were surely insufficient. The younger ones sometimes went out to go sliding or sledding\emdash or whatever\emdash and returned shrieking with excite\-ment\emdash 
but always glad to get within the City walls. Ben had once tried to make a pair of skis, according to directions in some ancient book or other, and had gotten himself half-buried in a drift of the white stuff. And even Ben\rquote 
s descriptions of what it was like to see and feel snow were distressingly vague and un\-satisfying.
\par Then, too, no one went out when it was actually snowing, as opposed to having the material merely lying about on the ground. Baley told himself, at this point, that the one thing ev\-
eryone agreed on was that it only snowed when it was very cold. It was not very cold now; it was merely cool. Those clouds did }{\i\fs20 not }{\fs20 mean it was going to snow. \emdash Somehow, he felt only minimally consoled.
\par This was not like the cloudy days on Earth, which he }{\i\fs20 had }{\fs20 seen. On Earth, the clouds were lighter; he was sure of that. They were grayish-white, even when they covered the sky solidly. Here, the light\emdash what there was of it\emdash 
was rather bil\-ious, a ghastly yellowish-slate.

\fs20 Was that because Aurora\rquote s sun was more orange than Earth\rquote s was?
\par He said, \'93Is the color of the sky\emdash unusual?\'94
\par Daneel looked up at the sky. \'93No, Partner Elijah. It is a storm.\'94
\par \'93Do you often have storms like this?\'94
\par \'93At this time of year, yes. Occasional thunderstorms. This is no surprise. It was predicted in the weather forecast yesterday and again this morning. It will be over well before daybreak and the fields can use the water. We\rquote 
ve been a bit subnormal in rainfall lately.\'94
\par \'93And }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 gets this cold, too? Is that normal, too?\'94
\par \'93Oh yes. \emdash But let us get into the airfoil, Partner Elijah. It can be heated.\'94
\par Baley nodded and walked toward the airfoil, which lay on the grassy plot where it had been brought to rest before lunch. He paused.
\par \'93Wait. I did not ask Gremionis for directions to Amadiro\rquote s es\-tablishment\emdash or office.\'94
\par \'93No need, Partner Elijah,\'94 said Daneel immediately, his hand in the crook of Baley\rquote s elbow, propelling him gently but unmis\-takably onward. \'93Friend Giska
rd has the map of the Institute clearly in his memory banks and he will take us to the Adminis\-tration Building. It is very likely that Dr. Amadiro has his office there.\'94
\par Giskard said, \'93My information is to the effect that Dr. Ama\-diro\rquote s office }{\i\fs20 is }{\fs20 in the Administration Building. If, by some chance, he is not at his office but is in his establishment, that is nearby.\'94
\par Again, Baley found himself crammed into the front seat be\-tween the two robots. He welcomed Daneel particularly, with his humanlike body warmth. Although Giskard\rquote s textilelike out\-
ermost layer was insulating and not as cold to the touch as bare metal would have been, he was the less attractive of the two in Baley\rquote s current chilly state.

\fs20 He said, \'93I don\rquote t like the way it looks out there.\'94
\par Daneel, perhaps in an effort to take Baley\rquote s \lquote mind off the ap\-pearance Outside, said, \'93Partner Elijah, how is it you knew that Dr. Vasilia had encouraged Mr. Gremionis\rquote 
 interest in Miss Gladia? I did not see that you had received any evidence to that effect.\'94
\par \'93I didn\rquote t,\'94 said Baley. \'93I\rquote ve been desperate enough to play long shots\emdash 
that is, to gamble on events of low probability. Gladia told me that Gremionis was the one person sufficiently interested in her to offer himself repeatedly. I thought he might have killed Jander out of jealousy. I didn\rquote t think he could possi\-
bly know enough about robotics to do it, but then I heard that Fastolfe\rquote s daughter Vasilia was a roboticist and resembled Gla\-dia physically. I wondered if Gremionis, having been fascinated by Gladia, might not have been fascinated by Vasilia
 earlier\emdash  and if the killing might possibly have been the result of a con\-spiracy between the two. It was by hinting obscurely at the existence of such a conspiracy that I was able to persuade Vasilia to see me.\'94
\par Daneel said, \'93But there was no conspiracy, Partner Elijah\emdash at least as far as the destruction of Jander was concerned. Vasilia and Gremionis could not have engineered that destruction, even if they had worked together.\'94
\par \'93Granted\emdash and yet Vasilia had been made nervous by the sug\-gestion of having had 
a connection with Gremionis. Why? When Gremionis told us of having been attracted to Vasilia first, and then to Gladia, I wondered if the connection between the two had been more indirect, if Vasilia might have encouraged the transfer for some reason more

\par \'93We may find out. It seemed to me that there was no impor\-tance in it to either Gremionis or Vasilia. Therefore, if it had any importance at all, it might be that a third person was involved. If it had anything to do with the Jander affair, then 
it ought to be a roboticist still more skillful than Vasilia\emdash and that might be Amadiro. So I hinted to him of the existence of a conspiracy by deliberately pointing out I had been questioning Gremionis and was calling from his establishment\emdash

Baley could not tell whether that statement was depressing in itself or whether he was influenced by the unpleasant livid light that bathed the landscape. He said, \'93Can you see well enough to drive, Giskard?\'94
\par \'93Certainly, sir, but I do not need to. The airfoil is equipped with a computerized radar that would enable it to avoid obsta\-cles on its own, even if I were, unaccountably, to fail in my task. It was this

The Administration Building, however, breathed officialdom and that, apparently, transcended ordinary human variety. It did not belong to the same genus as the dwelling places on Aurora, any more than an official building in Baley\rquote s home City re
sembled an apartment in the dwelling Sectors\emdash but the two official build\-ings on the two worlds of such widely different natures strangely resembled each other.
\par This was the first place on Aurora where, for an instant, Baley might have imagined himself on E
arth. Here were the same long cold bare corridors, the same lowest common denominator of design and decoration, with every light source designed so as to irritate as few people as possible and to please just as few.
\par There were some touches here that would have been absent on Earth\emdash 
the occasional suspended pots of plants, for instance, flourishing in the light and outfitted with devices (Baley guessed) for controlled and automatic watering. That natural touch was absent on Earth and its presence did not deli
ght him. Might such pots not sometimes fall? Might they not attract in\-sects? Might not the water drip?
\par There were some things missing here, too. On Earth, when one was within a City, there was always the vast, warm hum of people and machinery\emdash even in the most coldly official of ad\-ministrative structures. It was the \'93Busy Buzz of Brotherhood,
\'94 to use the phrase popular among Earth\rquote s politicians and journal\-ists.
\par Here, on the other hand, it was quiet. Baley had not particu\-larly noticed the quiet in the establishments he had visited that day and the day before, since everything had seemed so un\-
natural there that one more oddity escaped his notice. Indeed, he had been more aware of the soft susurration of insect life outside or of the wind through the vegetation than of the absence of the steady \'93Hum of Humanity\'94 (another popular phrase).

\par Here, however, where there seemed a touch of Earth, the ab\-sence of the \'93Hum\'94 was as disconcerting as was the distinct or\-ange touch to the artificial light\emdash which was far mo
re noticeable against the blank off-white of the walls here than among the busy decoration that marked the Auroran establishments.

mism. It stimulates the nerve endings and produces a rather sharp pain. Robots can pass, but human beings cannot. Any breach, of course, whether by human or robot, wifi set off an alarm.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93How can you tell there\rquote s a tingle field?\'94
\par \'93It can be seen, Partner Elijah, if you know what to look for. The air seems to twinkle a bit and the wall beyond that region has a faint greenish tinge as compared to the wall in front of it.\'94

\par A robot was approaching down the corridor on the other side of the field. (The twinkling of the field was more easily noted against the muted smoothnes
s of his metallic surface.) He seemed to ignore Giskard, but, for a moment, he hesitated as he looked from Baley to Daneel and back. And then, having made a decision, he addressed Baley. (Perhaps, thought Baley, Daneel looks too human to be human.)
\par The robot said, \'93Your name, sir?\'94
\par Baley said, \'93I am Plainclothesman Elijah Baley from Earth. I am accompanied by two robots of the establishment of Dr. Han Fastolfe\emdash Daneel Olivaw and Giskard Reventlov.\'94

\fs20 The robot studied the number a moment, as though compar\-ing it with a file in his memory banks. Then he nodded and said, \'93Serial number accepted. You may pass.\'94
\par Daneel and Giskard moved forward at once, but Baley found himself edging ahead slowly. He put out one arm as a way of testing the coming of pain.
\par Daneel said, \'93The field is gone, Partner Elijah. It will be re\-stored after we have passed through.\'94
\par Better safe than sorry, thought Baley, and continued his shuffle till he was well past the point where the barrier of the field might have existed.
\par The robots, showing no sign of impatience or condemnation, waited for Baley\rquote s reluctant steps to catch up with them.
\par They then stepped onto a helical ramp that was only two peo\-ple wide. The robot was first, by himself; Baley and Daneel stood side by side behind him (Daneel\rquote s hand rested lightly, but almost possessively, on Baley\rquote 
s elbow); and Giskard brought up the rear.
\par Baley was conscious of his shoes pointing upward just a bit uncomfortably and felt vaguely that it would be a little tiresome mounting this too-steep ramp and having to lean forward in order to avoid a clumsy slip
. Either the soles of his shoes or the surface of the ramp\emdash or both\emdash ought to be ridged. In fact, nei\-ther was.
\par The robot in the lead said, \'93Mr. Baley,\'94 as though warning of something, and the robot\rquote s hand then visibly tightened on the railing that it held.
\par At once, the ramp divided into sections that slid against each other to form steps. Immediately thereafter, the whole ramp began to move upward. It made a complete turn, passing up through the ceiling, a section of which had retracted, and, when }{\fs20 
it }{\fs20 came to a halt, they were on what was (presumably) the sec\-ond floor. The steps disappeared and the four stepped off.
\par Baley looked back curiously. \'93I suppose it will service those who want to go down as well, but what if there is a period where more people want to go up than down? It would end up sticking half a kilometer into the sky-or into the ground, in reverse.

\par \'93But it has to get down again, doesn\rquote t it?\'94
\par \'93It collapses at the top-or the bottom\emdash depending on which we\rquote re speaking of, Partner Elijah, and, in periods of nonuse, it unwinds, so to speak. This up-helix is descending now.\'94
\par Baley looked back. The smooth surface might be sliding downward, but it showed no irregularity or mark whose motion he could notice.
\par \'93And if someone should want to use it when it has moved up as far as it can?\'94
\par \'93Then one must wait for the unwinding, which would take less than a minute. \emdash There are ordinary flights of stairs as we
ll, Partner Elijah, and most Aurorans are not reluctant to use them. Robots almost always use the stairs. Since you are a visitor, you are being offered the courtesy of the helix.\'94
\par They were walking down a corridor again, toward a door more ornate than the others. \'93They are offering me courtesy, then,\'94 said Baley. \'93A hopeful sign.\'94
\par It was perhaps another hopeful sign that an Auroran now ap\-peared in the ornate doorway. He was tall, at least eight centi\-meters taller than Daneel, who was some five centimeters taller than Baley. The man in the doorway was broad as well, some\-
what heavyset, with a round face, a somewhat bulbous nose, curly dark hair, a swarthy complexion, and a smile.
\par It was the smile that was most noticeable. Wide and ap\-parently unforced, it revealed prominent teeth that were white and well-shaped.
\par He said, \'93Ah, it is Mr. Baley, the famous investigator from Earth, who has come to our little planet to show that I am a dreadful villain. Come in, come in. You are welcome. I am sorry if my able aide, Roboticist Maloon Cicis, gave you the impres\-
sion that I would be unavailable, but he is a cautious fellow and is a great deal more concerned about my time than I myself am.
\par He stepped to one side as Baley walked in and tapped him lightly with the fiat of his hand on the shoulder blade as he passed. It seemed to be a gesture of friendship of a kind that Baley had not yet experienced on Aurora.

\par \'93Exactly. Exactly. The man who intends to destroy Dr. Han Fastolfe as a political force upon this planet\emdash but that, as I hope to persuade you, does not really make me a villain. After all, I am not trying to prove that }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 
is Fastolfe who is a villain simply because of the foolish vandalism he committed on the structure of his own creation\emdash poor Jander. Let us say only that I will demonstrate that Fastolfe is\emdash mistaken.\'94

\par As the door closed, Amadiro gestured Baley jovially to a well-upholstered armchair and, with admirable economy, indicated, with his other arm, wall niches for Daneel and Giskard as well.
\par Baley noticed that Amadiro stared with a moment\rquote s hu
nger at Daneel and that, for that moment, his smile disappeared and a look that was almost predatory appeared on his face. It was gone quickly and he was smiling again. Baley was left to wonder if, perhaps, that momentary change of expression was an inven

Baley was taken aback. He did not know what to make of Amadiro and he had not expected this confusion within himself. Gremionis had described him as \'93standoffish.\'94 From what Cicis had said, he expected Amadiro to be autocratic. In person, how\-
ever, Amadiro seemed jovial, outgoing, even friendly. Yet if his words were to be trusted, Amadiro was calmly moving to end the investigation. He was doing it pitilessly\emdash and yet with what seemed to be a commiserating smile.
\par What was he?
\par Automatically, Baley glanced toward the niches where Gis\-kard and Daneel were standing, the primitive Giskard of course without expression, the advanced Daneel calm and quiet. That Daneel had ever met Amnadiro in his short existence was, on the face of }
{\fs20 it, }{\fs20 unlikely. Giskard, on the other hand, in his\emdash how many?\emdash decades of life might very well have met him.
\par Baley\rquote s lips tightened as he thought he might have asked Giskard in advance what Amadiro might be like. He might, in that case, be now better able to judge how much of this robot\-icist\rquote

\fs20 \'93What has this to do with the founding of the Institute, Dr. Amadiro?\'94
\par \'93Even proud and healthy individualism has its drawbacks. The greatest minds\emdash working singly, even for centuries\emdash cannot progress rapidly if they refu
se to communicate their findings. A knotty puzzle may hold up a scientist for a century, when it may be that a colleague has the solution already and is not even aware of the puzzle that it might solve. \emdash The Institute is an at\-
tempt, in the narrow field of robotics at least, to introduce a cer\-tain community of thought.\'94
\par \'93Is it possible that the particular knotty puzzle you are attack\-ing is that of the construction of a humaniform robot?\'94
\par Amadiro\rquote s eyes twinkled. \'93Yes, that is obvious, isn\rquote t it? It was twenty-six years ago that Fastolfe\rquote s new mathematical system, which he calls \lquote intersectional analysis,\rquote  made it possible to design humaniform robots
\emdash but he kept the system to himself. Years af\-terward, when all the difficult technical details were worked out,
 he and Dr. Sarton applied the theory to the design of Daneel. Then Fastolfe alone completed Jander. But all of those details were kept secret, also.
\par \'93Most roboticists shrugged and felt that this was natural. They could only try, individually, to work out the details for them\-selves. I, on the other hand, was struck by the possibility of an Institute in which efforts would be pooled. It wasn
\rquote t easy to per\-suade other roboticists of the usefulness of the plan, or to per\-suade the Legislature to fund }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 against Fastolfe\rquote s formidable op\-position, or to persevere through the years of effort, but here we are.

\par Baley said, \'93Why was Dr. Fastolfe opposed?\'94
\par \'93Ordinary self-love, to begin with\emdash and I have no fault to find with that, you understand. All of us have a very 
natural self-love. It comes with the territory of individualism. The point is that Fastolfe considers himself the greatest roboticist in history and also considers the humaniform robot his own particular achievement. He doesn\rquote 
t want that achievement duplicated by a group of roboticists, individually faceless compared to himself. I imagine he viewed it as a conspiracy of inferiors to dilute and deface his own great victory.\'94

\par \'93That he has and, for that matter, Dr. Vasiia has spoken to me of the difficulties of scientific advance among individualists. However, that does not stop me from wanting to hear your views on these matters. Nor should it stop you 
from wanting to tell me. For instance, do you want me to accept Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s interpretation of Globalist plans as unbiased and impartial\emdash and would you state that for the record? Or would you prefer to describe your plans in your own words?
\'94
\par \lquote Put that way, Mr. Baley, you intend to give me no choice.\'94
\par \'93None, Dr. Amadiro.\'94
\par \'93Very well. I\emdash we, I should say, for the people at the Institute are like-minded in this\emdash look into the future and wish to see hu\-manity opening ever more and ever newer planets to settlemen
t. We do not, however, want the process of self-selection to destroy the older planets or to reduce them to moribundity, as in the case\emdash pardon me\emdash of Earth. We don\rquote 
t want the new planets to take the best of us and to leave behind the dregs. You see that, don\rquote t you?\'94

will be as comfortable and as adjusted to ourselves as the old worlds were, so that we can go on to new worlds without leaving home, so to speak.\'94
\par \'93Won\rquote t the robots create robot worlds rather than human worlds?\'94

\par \'93Because you are an Earthman, my good Baley. I assure you that Aurorans would not find it pleasant to have Earthpeople swarming over the new worlds, building new beehives and form\-ing some sort of Galactic Empire in their trillions and quadril\-
lions and reducing the Spacer worlds to what? To insignificance at best and to extinction at worst.\'94

tinction that is clearly made. It permits human beings to find one place where they can be alone. You and I sit at our ease, while robots remain standing in their niches, as you see\'94\emdash Baley waved his arm toward Daneel\emdash \'94

\fs20 Baley tried to speak normally, but what camp out was a dim croak. He cleared his throat with unnecessary noise and said, \'93You can come farther into the room\emdash and you needn\rquote t remain silent, Daneel.\'94
 (Daneel had been on Earth. He knew the Earthly taboo against speech in the Personal.)
\par Daneel displayed that knowledge at once. He put his forefinger to his lips.
\par Baley said, \'93I know, I know, but forget it. If Amadiro can for\-get the Auroran taboo about robots in Personals, I can forget the Earthly taboo about speech there.\'94
\par \'93Will it not make you uncomfortable, Partner Elijah?\'94 asked Daneel in a low voice.
\par \'93Not a bit,\'94 said Baley in an ordinary one. (Actually, speech felt different with Daneel\emdash a robot. The sound of speech in a room such as this when, actually, no }{\i\fs20 human being }{\fs20 was present was not as horrifying as it might be.
 In fact, it was not horrify\-ing at all when only robots were present, however humaniform one of them might be. Baley could not say so, of course. Though Daneel had no feelings a human being could hurt, Baley had feelings on his behalf.)
\par And then Baley thought of something else and felt, quite in\-tensely, the sensation of being a thoroughgoing fool.
\par \'93Or,\'94 he said to Daneel, in a voice that was suddenly very low indeed, \'93are you suggesting silence because this room is bugged?\'94 The last word came out merely as a shaping of the mouth.
\par \'93If you mean, Partner Elijah, that people outside this room can detect what is spoken inside this room through some sort of eavesdropping device, that is quite impossible.\'94
\par \'93Why impossible?\'94
\par The toilet device flushed itself with quick and silent efficiency and Baley advanced toward the washbasin.
\par Daneel said, \'93On Earth, the dense packing of the Cities makes privacy impossible. Overhearing is taken for granted and to use a device to make overhearing more efficient might seem natural. If an Earthman wishes not to be overheard, he simply doesn
\rquote t speak, which may be why silence is so mandatory in places where there is a pretense of privacy, as in the very rooms you call Personals.

\fs20 \'93On Aurora, on the other hand, as 
on all the Spacer worlds, privacy is a true fact of life and is greatly valued. You remember Solaria and the diseased extremes to which it was carried there. But even on Aurora, which is no Solaria, every human being is insulated from every other human be
ing by the kind of space ex\-tension unthinkable on Earth and by a wall of robots, in addi\-tion. To break down that privacy would be an unthinkable act.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93Do you mean it would be a crime to bug this room?\'94
\par \'93Much worse, Partner Elijah. It would not be the act of a civilized Auroran gentleman.\'94
\par Baley looked about. Daneel, mistaking the gesture, plucked a towel out of the dispenser, which might not have been instantly apparent to the other\rquote s unaccustomed eyes, and offered it to Baley.
\par Baley accepted 
the towel, but that was not the object of his questing glance. It was a bug for which his eyes searched, for he found it difficult to believe that someone would forego an easy advantage on the ground that it would not be civilized behavior. It was, howeve
r, useless and Baley, rather despondently, knew it would be. He would not be able to detect an Auroran bug, even if one were there. He wouldn\rquote t know what to look for in a strange culture.
\par Whereupon he followed the course of another strand of suspi\-cion in his mind. \'93
Tell me, Daneel, since you know Aurorans better than I do, why do you suppose Amadiro is taking all this trouble with me? He talks to me at his leisure. He sees me out. He offers me the use of this room\emdash something Vasilia would not have done. He s
eems to have all the time in the world to spend on me. Politeness?\'94
\par \'93Many Aurorans pride themselves on their politeness. It may be that Amadiro does. He has several times stressed that he is not a barbarian.\'94
\par \'93Another question. Why do you think he was willing to have me bring you and Giskard into this room?\'94
\par \'93It seemed to me that that was to remove your suspicions that the offer of this room might conceal a trap.\'94
\par \'93Why should he bother? Because he was concerned over the possibility of my experiencing unnecessary anxiety?\'94

\par Baley shook his head. \'93Well, if this room is bugged and Amadiro can hear me, let him hear me. I don\rquote t 
consider him a civilized Auroran gentleman. He made it quite clear that, if I did not abandon my investigation, he would see to it that Earth as a whole would suffer. Is that the act of a civilized gentleman? Or of an incredibly brutal blackmailer?\'94

\par Daneel said, \'93An Auroran gentleman may find it necessary to utter threats, but if so, he would do it in a gentlemanly manner.\'94
\par \'93As Amadiro did. It is, then, the manner and not the content of speech that marks the gentleman. But then, Daneel, you are a robot and therefore can not really criticize a human being, can you?\'94
\par Daneel said, \'93It would be difficult for me to do so. But may I ask a question, Partner Elijah? Why did you ask permission to bring friend Giskard and me into this room? It had seemed to me that you were reluctant, earlier, to believe you were in dan\-
ger. Have you now decided that you are not safe except in our presence?\'94
\par \'93No, not at all, Daneel. I am now quite convinced that I am not in danger and have not been.\'94
\par \'93Yet there was a distinctly suspicious cast about your actions when you entered this room, Partner Elijah. You searched it.\'94
\par Baley said, \'93Of course! I said I am not in danger, but I do not say there is no danger.\'94
\par \'93I do not think I see the distinction, Partner Elijah,\'94 said Daneel.
\par \'93We will discuss it later, Daneel. I am still not certain as to whether this room is bugged or not.\'94

rattled across a hollow world; that both were so }{\i\fs20 sudden; }{\fs20 and that rain could be so like an inverted bowl of water, endlessly pouring.

\par \'93Surely that would not be advisable, Partner Elijah. Some rain, at least, will continue past midnight and if the Chairman ar\-rives tomorrow morning, as Dr. Amadiro i
mplied he might, it might be wise to spend the evening in consultation with Dr. Fastolfe.\'94
\par Baley forced himself to turn around, face in the direction from which he wanted to flee, and look into Daneers eyes. They seemed deeply concerned, but Baley thought dismally that that was merely the result of his own interpretation of the appear\-
ance of those eyes. The robot had no feelings, only positronic surges that mimicked those feelings. (And perhaps human beings had no feelings, only neuronic surges that were inter\-preted as feelings.)
\par He was somehow aware that Amadiro was gone. He said, \'93Arnadiro delayed me deliberately\emdash by ushering me into the Personal, by his senseless talk, by his preventing you or Giskard from interrupting and warning me about the storm. He 
would even have tried to persuade me to tour the building or dine with him. He desisted only at the sound of the storm. That was what he was waiting for.\'94

\par Giskard was waiting quietly at the door.
\par Baley paused and closed his eyes for a moment. Then he said in a low voice, to himself rather than to Daneel, \'93I must do it,\'94 and moved forward again.

 Baley was conscious of a thin whine, which he imagined to be the wind curling around the body of the airfoil as it cut its way th
rough the protesting atmosphere. Then the airfoil lurched and Baley, who could not for his life have helped it, seized Daneel in a desperate grip around the neck.
\par Daneel waited a moment. When Baley had caught his breath and his grip grew less rigid, Daneel released himself easily from the other\rquote s embrace, while somewhat tightening the pressure of his own arm around Bale>\rquote .
\par He said, \'93In order to maintain course, Partner Elijah, Giskard must counter the wind by an asymmetric ordering of the airfoil\rquote s jets. Th
ey are sent to one side so as to cause the airfoil to lean into the wind and these jets have to be adjusted in force and di\-rection as the wind itself changes force and direction. There are none better at this than Giskard, but, even so, there are occa\-
sional jiggles and lurches. You must excuse Giskard, then, if he does not participate in our conversation. His attention is fully on the airfoil.\'94
\par \'93Is it\emdash it safe?\'94 Baley felt his stomach contract at the thought of playing with the wind in this fashion. He was devoutly glad he had not eaten for some hours. He could not\emdash dared not\emdash 
be sick in the close confines of the airfoil. The very thought un\-settled him further and he tried to concentrate on something else.
\par He thought of running the strips back on Earth, of r
acing from one moving strip to its neighboring faster strip, and then to its neighboring still faster strip, and then back down into the slower regions, leaning expertly into the wind either way; in one direction as one fastered (an odd word used by no on
e but strip\-racers) and in the other direction, as one slowered. In his younger days, Daneel could do it without pause and without error.

Not quite the same, to be sure. In the City, the speed of the strips was a fixed quantity. What wind there was blew in abso\-lutely
 predictable fashion, since it was only the result of the movement of the strips. Here in the storm, however, the wind had a mind of its own or, rather, it depended on so many vari\-
ables (Baley was deliberately striving for rationality) that it seemed to have a mind of its own\emdash 
and Giskard had to allow for that. That was all. Otherwise, it was just running the strips with an added complication. The strips were moving at variable\emdash and sharply changing\emdash speeds.
\par Baley muttered, \'93What if we blow into a tree?\'94
\par \'93Very unlikely, Partner Elijah. Giskard is far too skillful for that. And we are only very slightly above the ground, so that the jets are particularly powerful.\'94
\par \'93Then we\rquote ll hit a rock. It will cave us in underneath.\'94
\par \'93We will not hit a rock, Partner Elijah.\'94

\fs20 Baley said, \'93Find them. Your orders are clear.\'94
\par There was hesitation. Clear hesitation.
\par Baley finally remembered to move his right foot\emdash he hoped properly. He should have done it before, but his physical body was not responding properly to his thoughts.
\par Still the robots
 hesitated and Baley grieved over that. He was not a Spacer. He did not know the proper words, the proper tone, the proper air with which to handle robots with the proper efficiency. A skilled roboticist could, with a gesture, a lift of an eyebrow, direct
 a robot as though it were a marionette of which he held the strings. \emdash Especially if the robot were of his own design.
\par But Bale>\rquote  was only an Earthman.
\par He frowned\emdash that was easy to do in his misery\emdash and whis\-pered a weary \'93Go!\'94 and motioned with his hands.
\par Perhaps that added the last small and necessary quantity of weight to his order\emdash or perhaps an end had simply been reached to the time it took for the robots\rquote  positronic pathways to deter\-
mine, by voltage and counter-voltage, how to sort out their in\-structions according to the Three Laws.
\par Either way, they had made up their minds and, after that, there was no further hesitation. They moved back to their vehi\-cle, whatever and wherever it was, with such determined speed that they seemed simply to disappear.
\par The door the robot had held open now closed of its own ac\-cord. Bale>\rquote  had moved his foot in order to place it in the path\-
way of the closing door. He wondered distantly if his foot would be cut off cleanly or if its bones would be crushed, but he didn\rquote t move it. Surely no vehicle would be designed to make such a misadventure possible.
\par He was alone again. He had forced robots to leave a patently unwell human being by playing on the force of the orders given them by a competent robot master who had been intent on strengthening the Second Law for his own purposes\emdash 
and had done it to the point where Baley\rquote s own quite apparent lies had subordinated the First Law to }{\fs20 it.

 the door and jamb so that the door would not entirely close. He then removed his foot.
\par Now to think\emdash if he could. There was no point to keeping the door open unless he meant to get out. Was there, however, any purpose in getting out?

\par It would also be harder for Giskard to locate him, but Giskard would be under a much more intense instruction to guard Bale>\rquote  than the pursuing robots were to find him. The primary task of the former would be to locate Baley\emdash 
and of the latter, to locate Daneel.

It was Giskard. They had come here\emdash both of them\emdash and Giskard explained the situation to me quickly.~ I set right about securing Daneel, but he wouldn\rquote

\par \'93Daneel remained behind, of course. It made him very un\-happy, but Giskard insisted that I order him t
o stay at the very top of my voice. You must have given Giskard some mighty strict orders. Then we got in touch with Dr. Fastolfe and, after that, we took my personal airfoil.\'94
\par Baley shook his head wearily. \'93You should not have come along, Gladia. Your place was here, making sure Daneel was safe.\'94
\par Gladia\rquote s face twisted into scorn. \'93And leave you dying in the storm, for all we knew? Or being taken up by Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s ene\-mies? I have a little holograph of myself letting that happen. No, Elijah, I might have
 been needed to keep the other robots away from you if they had gotten to you first. I may not be much good in most ways, but any Solarian can handle a mob of robots, let me tell you. We\rquote re used to }{\fs20 it.\'94

Twice before, it had happened. Once the night before when, as now, he was falling asleep and once earlier this evening when he had slipped into unconsciousness beneath the tree in the storm. Each time, something had occurred to him, some enlight\-

\par And it had stayed with him as briefly as the lightning had.
\par What was it?
\par Would it come to him again?

\par The search for whatever it was, however, slid slowly away. It would no more come on call than a unicorn would in a world in which unicorns did not exist.
\par It was easier to think of Gladia and of how she had felt. There had been the direct touch of the silkiness of her blouse, but be\-neath it were the small and delicate arms, the smooth back.
\par Would he have dared to kiss her if his legs had not begun to buckle beneath him? Or would that have been going too far?

But those thoughts washed away, too. Somehow there was soft music in the air and the temperature had risen a bit. The cover had vanished and so had his nightclothes. He felt his head moved into the cradle of her arms and pressed against softness.
\par With a detached surprise, he knew, from her position, that the softness was her left breast and that it was centered, contrast\-ingly, with its nipple hard against his lips.
\par Softly, she was singing to the music, a sleepily joyful tune he did not recognize.

\par He did not help and, when he did respond with heightened excitement and climax, it was only out of helplessness to do oth\-erwise.
\par She seemed tireless and he did not want her to stop. Aside from the sensuality of sexual response, he felt again what he had felt earlier, the total luxury of the infant\rquote s passivity.
\par And, finally, he could respond no more and, it seemed, she could do no more and she lay with her head in the hollow where his left shoulder met his chest and her left arm lay across his ribs, her fingers stroking the short, curling hairs tenderly.
\par He seemed to hear her murmuring, \'93Thank you\emdash  Thank you\emdash \'94
\par For what? he wondered.
\par He was scarcely conscious of her now, for this utterly soft end of a hard day was as soporific as the fabled nepenthe and he could feel himself slipping away, as though his fingertips were relaxing from the edge of the cliff of harsh reality in order that
 he might drop\emdash drop\emdash through the soft clouds of gathering sleep into the slowly swaying ocean of dreams.

Baley said, \'93You mean that the Chairman wiU listen to me, to Fastolfe, and to Amadiro, and then come to a decision?\'94
\par \lquote Possibly. On the other hand, sir, he may remain uncertain and require further testimony, further thought\emdash or both.\'94

if one may judge from their actions. Most of the leg\-islators, however, will go along with the Chairman\rquote s decision, whatever that might be. Dr. Fastolfe or Dr. Amadiro\emdash  whichever it may be who will be decided against by the Chair\-man
\emdash will then be sure to find himself in a small minority when the vote is taken.\'94
\par \'93How sure, Giskard?\'94
\par \'93Almost sure. The Chairman\rquote s term of office is ordinarily thirty years, with the opportunity for reelection by the Legislature for another thirty years. If, however, a vote were to go against the Chairman\rquote 
s recommendation, the Chairman would be forced to resign forthwith and there would be a governmental crisis while the Legislature tried to find anothe
r Chairman under conditions of bitter dispute. Few legislators are willing to risk that and the chance of getting a majority to vote against the Chairman, when that is the consequence, is almost nil.\'94

it seemed more intimate than an ordinary dining room. It was small and plain, with no more in the way of furnishings than a table and two chairs and when Daneel retired, he did not move into a niche. In fact, there were no niches and, for a mo\-

\par That he was not really alone, he was certain. There would be robots on instant call. Still, it was a room for two\emdash a no-robots room\emdash a room (Baley hesitated at the thought) for lovers.
\par On the table there were two stacks of pancakelike objects that did not smell like pancakes but smelled good. Two containers of what looked like melted butter (but might not be) flanked them. There was a pot of the hot drink (
which Baley had tried and had not liked very much) that substituted for coffee.

\'94 he said, but with such for\-mality that she laughed again.
\par \'93Poor Elijah,\'94 she said. \'93You\rquote re embarrassed.\'94
\par The fact that she recognized that embarrassed him even more. Baley had been prepared for contrition, disgust, shame, affected indifference, tears\emdash everything but the frankly erotic attitude she had assumed.
\par She said, \'93Well, don\rquote t suffer so. You\rquote re hungry. You hardly ate last night. Get some calories inside you and you\rquote ll feel more car\-nal.\'94
\par Baley looked doubtfully at the pancakes that weren\rquote t.
\par Gladia said, \'93Oh! You\rquote ve probably never seen these. They\rquote re Solarian delicacies. Pachinkas! I had to reprogram my chef be\-fore he could make them properly. In the first place, you have to use imported Solarian grain. It won\rquote

\par She picked one up, holding it daintily between the thumb and middle finger of each hand, then took a small bite, slowly, and licked at the golden, semiliquid ifiling that flowed out.
\par Baley imitated her action. The pachinka was hard to the touch and not too hot to hold. He put one end cautiously in his mouth and found it resisted biting. He put more muscle into it and the pachinka cracked
 and he found the contents flowing over his hands.
\par \'93The bite was too large and too forceful,\'94 said Gladia, rushing to him with a napkin. \'93Now lick at it. No one eats a pachinka neatly. There\rquote s no such thing. You\rquote re supposed to wallow in it. Ideally, you\rquote re

Baley tried a hesitant lick and his expression was clear enough.
\par \'93You like it, don\rquote t you?\'94 said Gladia.
\par \'93It\rquote s delicious,\'94 said Baley and he bit away at it slowly and gently. It wasn\rquote t too sweet and it seemed to soften and melt in the mouth. It scarcely required swallowing.
\par He ate three pachinkas and it was only shame that kept him from asking for more. He licked at his fingers without urging and eschewed the use of napkins, for he wanted none of it to be wasted on an inanimate object.
\par \'93Dip your fingers and hands in the cleanser, Elijah,\'94 and she showed him. The \'93melted butter\'94 was a finger bowl, obviously.
\par Baley did as he was shown and then dried his hands. He sniffed at them and there was no odor whatever.
\par She said, }{\i\fs20 \'93Are }{\fs20 you embarrassed about last night, Elijah? Is that all you feel?\'94
\par What did one say? Baley wondered.
\par Finally, he nodded. \'93I\rquote m afraid I am, Gladia. It\rquote s not all I feel, by twenty kilometers or more, but I }{\i\fs20 am }{\fs20 embarrassed. Stop and think. I\rquote m an Earthman and you know that, but for the time being you\rquote

 (If he looked as unhappy as he felt, he looked unhappy indeed.)
\par She must have thought so, for she reached out to him and stroked his hand. \'93I won\rquote t hate you, Elijah. Why should I? You did nothing to me that I can object to. I did }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 to you and I\rquote

 choreography. Every step of it is dictated by fashion, from the method of approach to the moment of departure. There is noth\-ing unexpected, nothing spontaneous. On Solaria, since there was so little sex, nothing was
 given or taken. And on Aurora, sex was so stylized that, in the end, nothing was given or taken either. Do you understand?\'94

\par \'93I\rquote ll try not to, Dr. Fastolfe.\'94
\par \'93For instance, Mr. Baley, do not offer him your hand\emdash if you will forgive my rudeness.\'94

\par \'93The fault is indeed mine,\'94 said Dr. Fastolfe. \'93It was a matter of such basic knowledge to me that it never occurred to me that it had to be explained.\'94
\par Baley grunted. \'93Yes, I thought so.\'94

Together?\'94 asked Baley.
\par \'93Undoubtedly. You see, Amadiro suggested my establishment as the meeting place, thus granting me the advantage of home ground. He will therefore have the chance of offering, out of ap\-
parent politeness, to call for the Chairman and bring him here. After all, they must both come here. This will give him a few minutes to talk privately with the Chairman and push his point of view.~\rquote 
\par \'93That is scarcely fair,\'94 said Baley. \'93Could you have stopped that?\'94
\par \'93I didn\rquote t want to. Aniadiro takes a calculated risk. He may say something that will irritate the Chairman.\'94
\par \'93Is the Chairman particularly irritable by nature?\'94
\par \'93No. No more so than any Chairman in the fifth decade of his term of office. Still, the necessity of strict adherence to protocol, the further necessity of never taking sides, and the actuality of arbitrar
y power all combine toward making a certain irritability inevitable. And Amadiro is not always wise. His jovial smile, his white teeth, his exuding bonhomie can be extremely irritating when those upon whom he lavishes it are not in a good mood, for some r
eason. \emdash But I must go meet them, Mr. Baley, and supply what I hope will be a more substantial version of charm. Please stay here and don\rquote t move from that chair.\'94
\par Baley could do nothing but wait now. He thought, irrelevantly, that he had been on Aurora for just a bit short of fifty standard hours.

\par However, since most of his shortness was in his thighs, the Chair
man, when all were seated, was not noticeably inferior in height to the others. Indeed, he was thickset, with a massive chest and shoulders, and looked almost overpowering under those conditions.
\par His head was large, too, but his face was lined and marked b

\par His voice suited him\emdash deep and decisive. Age had robbed it of some of its timbre, perhaps, and lent it a bit of harshness, but in a Chairman (Baley thought) that might help rather than hinder.

He said, \'93Mr. Chainnan,\'94 without holding out his hand. Then, with an offhand nod, he said, \'93And, of course, I have met Dr. Amadiro.\'94
\par Amadiro\rquote s smile did not waver at the touch of insolence in Baley\rquote s voice.
\par The Chairman, who had not acknowledged Baley\rquote s greeting, placed his hands on each knee, fingers spread apart, and said, \'93Let us get started and let us see if we can\rquote t make this as brief and as productive as possible.
\par \'93Let me stress first that I wish to get past this matter of the misbehavior\emdash or possible misbehavior\emdash 
of an Earthman and strike instantly to the heart of the matter. Nor, in dealing with tl~e heart of the matter, are we speaking of this overblown mat\-ter of the robot. Disrupting the 
activity of a robot is a matter for the civil courts; it can result in a judgment of the infringement of property rights and the inflicting of a penalty of costs but noth\-ing more than that. What\rquote 
s-more, if it should be proved that Dr. Fastolfe had rendere
d the robot, Jander Panell, inoperable, it is a robot who, after all, he helped design, whose construction he supervised, and the ownership of whom he held at the time of the inoperability. No penalty is likely to apply, since a person may do what he like
s with his own.
\par \'93What is really at issue is the matter of the exploration and settlement of the Galaxy: whether we of Aurora carry it through alone, whether we do it in collaboration with the other Spacer worlds, or whether we leave it to Earth. Dr. Amadiro
 and the Globalists favor having Aurora shoulder the burden alone; Dr. Fastolfe wishes to leave it to Earth.
\par \'93If we can settle this matter, then the affair of the robot can be left to the civil courts, and the question of the Earthman\rquote s be\-havior will probably become moot, and we can simply get rid of him.
\par \'93Therefore, let me begin by asking whether Dr. Amadiro is prepared to accept Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s position in order to achieve unity of decision or whether Dr. Fastolfe is prepared to accept Dr. Amadiro\rquote s position with the same end in view.\'94

 this statement, abandon your position?\'94
\par Fastolfe said, \'93Dr. Amadiro\rquote s compromise has scarcely any\-thing of substance in it, Mr. Chairman. I am willing to offer a compromise of greater significance. Why should not the worlds of the Galaxy be thrown open to
 Spacers and Earthpeople alike? The Galaxy is large and there would be room for both. I would be willing to accept such an arrangement.\'94
\par \'93No doubt,\'94 said Amadiro quickly, \'93for it is no compromise. The over eight billion population of Earth is more than half again the population of all the Spacer worlds combined. Earth\rquote 
s people are short-lived and are used to replacing their losses quickly. They lack our regard for individual human life. They will swarm over the new worlds at any cost, multiplying like in\-se
cts, and will preempt the Galaxy even while we are making a bare beginning. To offer Earth a supposedly equal chance at the Galaxy is to }{\i\fs20 give }{\fs20 them the Galaxy\emdash and that is not equality. Earthpeople must be confined to Earth.\'94

\par \'93And what have you to say to that, Dr. Fastolfe?\'94 asked the Chairman.
\par Fastolfe sighed. \'93My views are on record. I\rquote m sure I don\rquote t need to repeat them. Dr. Amadiro plans to use humaniform ro\-bots to build the settled worlds that human Aurorans will then enter, ready-made, yet he doesn\rquote t ev
en have humaniform robots. He cannot construct them and the project would not work, even if he did have them. No compromise is possible unless Dr. Amadiro consents to the principle that Earthpeople may at least share in the task of the settlement of new w
orlds.\'94
\par \'93Then no compromise is possible,\'94 said Amadiro.
\par The Chairman looked displeased. \'93I\rquote m afraid that one of you two }{\i\fs20 must }{\fs20 give in. I do not intend Aurora to be torn apart in an emotional orgy on a question this important.\'94

\par \'93That is exactly what he }{\i\fs20 is }{\fs20 trying to do\emdash \'94
\par \'93Slander!\'94 put in Fastolfe in a low voice.
\par \'93Not if I can prove it, which I can,\'94 said Amadiro. \'93The argu\-ment may be an emotional one, but it will be effective. You see that, Mr. Chairman, don\rquote

\par }{\fs20 \'93He himself admits he is the only human being who could have done so. You know this.\'94
\par \'93I know,\'94 said the Chairman, \'93but I wanted to hear you say this, not to your constituency, not to the media, but to me\emdash in private. And you have done so.\'94
\par He turned to Fastolfe. \'93And what do you say, Dr. Fastolfe? Are you the only man who could have destroyed the robot?\'94
\par \'93Without leaving physical marks? I am, as far as I know. I don\rquote t believe that Dr. Amadiro has the skill in robotics to do so and I am constantly amazed that, after having foun
ded his Robotics Institute, he is so eager to proclaim his own incapacity, even with all his associates at his back\emdash and to do so publicly.\'94 He smiled at Amadiro, not entirely without malice.
\par The Chairman sighed. \'93No, Dr. Fastolfe. No rhetorical tricks now. Let us dispense with sarcasm and clever thrusts. What is your defense?\'94
\par \'93Why, only that I did no harm to Jander. I do not say anyone did. It was chance\emdash the uncertainty principle at work on the positronic pathways. It can happen every so often. Let Dr. Amadiro merely admit that }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 
was chance, that no one be ac\-cused without evidence, and we can then argue the competing proposals about settlement on their own merits.\'94

s guilt is irresponsible. I will not back down and I will win. Mr. Chairman, you know I will win and it seems to me that the only rational step to be taken is to force Dr. Fastolfe to accept his defeat in the interest of global unity.\'94
\par Fastolfe said quickly, \'93And that brings me to the matter of the investigation I have asked Mr. Baley of Earth to undertake.\'94
\par And Amadiro said, just as quickly, \'93
A move I opposed when it was first suggested. The Earthman may be a clever investigator, but he is unfamiliar with Aurora and can accomplish nothing here. Nothing, that is, except to strew slander and to hold Aurora up to the Spacer worlds in a
n undignified and ridiculous light. There have been satirical pieces on the matter in half a dozen important Spacer hyperwave news programs on as many different worlds. Recordings of these have been sent to your office.\'94
\par \'93And have been brought to my attention,\'94 said the Chairman.
\par \'93And there has been murmuring here on Aurora,\'94 Amadiro drove on. \'93It would be to my selfish interest to allow the investi\-gation to continue. It is costing Fastolfe support among the populace and votes among the legislators. The longer it con\-
tinues, the more certain I am of victory, but }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 is damaging Aurora and I do not wish to add to my certainty at the cost of harm to my world. -I suggest\emdash with respect\emdash that you end the in\-vestigation, Mr. Chainna

greater length than was perhaps necessary, so that there would be time for the damaging of my machine, then detained me further in order that I might leave after the thunderstorm had begun, thus making sure that I would be ill in transit. He had studied E
arth\rquote 
s social conditions, as he told me several times, so he would know what my reaction to the storm might be. It seemed to me that it was his plan to send his robots after us and, when they came upon our stalled airfoil, to have them take us all back to t
he Institute grounds, presumably so that I might be treated for my illness but actually so that he might have Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s robots.\'94

\par The Chairman stood up, at once losing some of his presence, since he scarcely unfolded to a greater than sitting height. \'93Let me take a short walk, so that I might consider what I have heard so far. I will be right back.\'94 He left for the Personal.

\par Fastolfe leaned in the direction of Baley and Baley met him halfway. (Amadiro looked on in casual unconcern, as though it scarcely mattered to him what they might have to say to each other.)
\par Fastolfe whispered, \'93Have you anything better to say?\'94

turned, reseated himself, and turned a hard and rather baleful glance at the Earthman.
\par He said, \'93Mr. Baley of Earth?\'94
\par \'93Yes, Mr. Chairman.\'94
\par \'93I think you are wasting my time, but I do not want it said that I did not give either side a full hearing, }{\i\fs20 even }{\fs20 
when it seemed to be wasting my time. Can you offer me a motive that would account for Dr. Amadiro acting in the mad way in which you accuse him of acting.\'94
\par \'93Mr. Chairman,\'94 said Baley in a tone approaching despera\-tion, \'93there is indeed a motive\emdash a very good one. It rests on the fact that Dr. Amadiro\rquote 
s plan for settling the Galaxy will come to nothing if he and his Institute cannot produce humaniform ro\-bots. So far he has produc
ed none and can produce none. Ask him if he is willing to have a legislative committee examine his Institute for any indication that successful humaniform robots are being produced or designed. If he is willing to maintain that successful humaniforms are 
on the assembly lines or even on the drawing boards\emdash or even in adequate theoretical formulation\emdash  and if he is prepared to demonstrate that fact to a qualified com\-
mittee, I will say nothing more and admit that my investigation has achieved nothing.\'94 He held his breath.
\par The Chairman looked at Amadiro, whose smile had faded.
\par Ainadiro said, \'93I will admit that we have no humaniform ro\-bots in prospect at the moment.\'94
\par \'93Then I will continue,\'94 said Baley, resuming his interrupted breathing with something very much like a gasp. \'93
Dr. Amadiro can, of course, find all the information he needs for his project if he turns to Dr. Fastolfe, who has the information in his head, but Dr. Fastolfe will not cooperate in this matter.\'94
\par \'93No, I will not,\'94 murmured Fastolfe, \'93under any conditions.\'94
\par \'93But, Mr. Chairman,\'94 Baley continued, \'93Dr. Fastolfe is }{\i\fs20 not }{\fs20 the only individual who has the secret of the design and con\-struction of humaniformn robots.\'94

No?\'94 said the Chairman. \'93Who else would know? Dr. Fas\-tolfe himself looks astonished at your comment, Mr. Baley.\'94 (For the first time, he did not add \'93of Earth.\'94)
\par \'93I am indeed astonished,\'94 said Fastolfe. \'93To my knowledge, I am certainly the only one. I don\rquote t know what Mr. Baley means.\'94
\par Amadiro said, with a small curling of the lip, \'93I suspect Mr. Baley doesn\rquote t know, either.\'94
\par Baley felt hemmed in. He looked from one to the other and felt that not one of them\emdash not one\emdash was on his side.
\par He said, \'93Isn\rquote t it true that any humaniform robot would know? Not consciously perhaps, not in such a way as to be able to give instructions in the matter\emdash but the information would surely be there within him, wouldn\rquote 
t it? If a humaniform robot was properly questioned, his answers and responses would be\-tray his design and construction. Eventua
lly, given enough time and given questions properly framed, a humaniform robot would yield information that would make it possible to plan the design of other humaniform robots. \emdash 
To put it briefly, no machine can be of secret design if the machine itself is available for suffi\-ciently intense study.\'94
\par Fastolfe seemed struck. \'93I see what you mean, Mr. Baley, and you are right. I had never thought of that.\'94
\par \'93With respect, Dr. Fastolfe,\'94 said Baley, \'93I must tell you that, like all Aurorans, you have a peculiarly individualistic pride. You are entirely too satisfied with being the best roboticist, the }{\i\fs20 only }{\fs20 
roboticist who can construct humaniforms\emdash so you blind yourself to the obvious.\'94
\par The Chairman relaxed into a smile. \'93He has you there, Dr. Fastolfe. I have wond
ered why you were so eager to maintain that you were the only one with the know-how to destroy Jander when that so weakened your political case. I see clearly now that you would rather have your political case go down than your uniqueness.\'94
\par Fastolfe chafed visibly.
\par As for Amadiro, he frowned and said, \'93Has this anything to do with the problem under discussion?\'94
\par \'93Yes, }{\fs20 it }{\fs20 does,\'94 said Baley, his confidence rising. \'93You cannot force any information from Dr. Fastolfe directly. Your robots cannot be ordered to do him harm, to torture him into revealing

\par \'93I do! Absolutely! None of it is true!\'94 said Amadiro. It had been a noticeable while since he had smiled. \'93

\par Baley said, \'93She was a Solarian. Her concept of \lquote husband\rquote  was not Auroran.\'94
\par \'93Obviously not,\'94 said the Chairman.
\par \'93But she did have enough of a sense of reality to keep it to herself, Mr. Chairman. She never told of this charade, as Dr. Fastolfe calls it, to any Auroran. She told me the day before yes\-
terday because she wanted to urge me on in the investigation of something that meant so much to her. Yet even so, I imagine she would not have used the word if she had not known I was an Earthman and would understand it in her sense\emdash

it is only fair to Dr. Amadiro for me to remind him that Giskard, a robot who was also present at the meeting, can, if asked to do so, repeat the entire conversation, word for word, using the voice and intonation of both parties. In short, the con\-
versation is recorded.\'94
\par Ainadiro burst into a kind of rage. \'93Mr. Chairman, the robot, Giskard, was designed, constructed, and programmed by Dr. Fastolfe, who announces himself to be the best roboticist who exists and who is bitterly opposed to me. Can we trust a record\-

\par The Chainnan turned to look at Baley and Baley said, \'93Mr. Chairman, if I have nothing at all, then Dr. Amnadiro should not hesitate to deny, for the record, any contact with Jander\emdash 
but he does not do so. As it happens, in the course of my investigation, I spoke to Dr. Vasilia Aliena, the daughter of Dr. Fastolfe. I spoke also to a young Auroran named Santirix Gremionis. In the recordings of 
both interviews, it will be plain that Dr. Vasilia encouraged Gremionis to pay court to Gladia. You may question Dr. Vasiia as to her purpose in so doing and as to whether this course of action had been suggested to her by Dr. Arnadiro. It also appears th

before the attempt ended when Jander went out of action. His concentration then shifted to Daneel. He felt perhaps that he had only a few tests and ob\-servations left to make and so he set up the trap of yesterday evening, as I said earlier in my\emdash

\par \'93So you have explained. But Gladia, you learned from Jander to take; you learned from me\emdash not that I meant it\emdash to give. 
If you benefit by learning, is it not only right and fair that you should teach in your turn? Gremionis is sufficiently attracted to you to be willing to learn. He already defies Auroran convention by persisting in the face of your refusal. He will defy m

\par Gladia looked searchingly into his eyes. \'93Elijah, are you trying to get rid of me?\'94
\par Slowly, Baley nodded. \'93Yes, Gladia, I am. It\rquote s your happiness I want at this moment, more than I have ever wanted anything for myself or for Earth. I can\rquote t give you happiness, but if Gremionis can give it to you, I will be as }{\i\fs20

 for he knew now that he would be able to leave Earth and face the, conditions of whatever new world he might settle on, he and Ben\emdash and perhaps Jessie.

casually recall the situation. Yet you did not do that entirely efficiently, perhaps because your powers are limited\emdash \'94

\par \'93Aurorans live behind walls made of robots, who shield them from all the vicissitudes of life and who, in Amadiro\rquote 
s plans, would build up shielded societies to wall up Aurorans settling new worlds. Aurorans also live behind walls made up of their own extended lives, which forces them to overvalue individ\-
uality and keeps them from pooling their scientific resources. Nor do they indulge in the rough-and-tumble of controversy, but, through their Chairman, demand a short-circuiting of all uncertainty and that decisions on solutions be reached before 
problems are aired. They could not be bothered with actually thrashing out best solutions. What they wanted were }{\i\fs20 quiet }{\fs20 solu\-tions.

laxy and establish what will someday become a Galactic Empire.
\par \'93All this was Dr. Fastolfe\rquote s reasoning and I agreed with it. Dr. Fastolfe was, however, satisfied with the reasoning,
 while I, given my own abilities, could not be. I had to examine the mind of at least one Earthman directly, in order that I might check my conclusions, and you were the Earthman I thought I could bring to Aurora. The immobilization of Jander served both 
to stop Amadiro and to be the occasion for your visit. I pushed Miss Gladia very slightly to have her suggest your coming to Dr. Fas\-

Baley said, \'93How do you know I am representative of Earth-people generally?\'94
\par \'93I know you are not. But from your mind, I know there are some like you and we will build with those. I will see to it\emdash and now that I know clearly the path that must be followed, I will prepare other robots like myself\emdash 
and they will see to it, too.\'94
\par Baley said suddenly, \'93You mean that mind-reading robots will come to Earth?\'94
\par \'93No, I do not. And you are right to be alarmed. Involving ro\-bots directly will mean the construction of the very walls that are dooming Aurora and the Spacer worlds to paralysis. Earth\-
men will have to settle the Galaxy without robots of any kind. It will mean difficulties, dangers, and harm without measure\emdash  events that robots would labor to prevent if they were present\emdash 
 but, in the end, human beings will be better off for having worked on their own. And perhaps someday\emdash some long-away day in the future\emdash robots can intervene once more. Who can tell?\'94
\par Baley said curiously, \'93Do you see the future?\'94
\par \'93No, sir, but studying minds as I do, I can tell dimly that there are laws that govern human behavior as the Three Laws of Robotics govern robotic behavior; and with these it may be that the future will be dealt with, after a fashion\emdash 
someday. The human laws are far more complicated than the Laws of Robotics are and I do not have any idea as to how they may be orga\-nized. They may be statistical in nature, so that they might not be fruitfully expresse
d except when dealing with huge popula\-tions. They may be very loosely binding, so that they might not make sense unless those huge populations are unaware of the operation of those laws.\'94
\par \'93Tell me, Giskard, is this what Dr. Fastolfe refers to as the fu\-ture science of \lquote psychohistory\rquote ?\'94
\par \'93Yes, sir. I have gently inserted it into his mind, in order that the process of working it out begin. It will be needed someday, now that the existence of the Spacer worlds as a long-lived robot\-ized culture is coming to an
 end and a new wave of human ex\-pansion by short-lived human beings\emdash without robots\emdash will be beginning.
