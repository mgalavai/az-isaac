\viewkind4\uc1\pard\qc\lang1033\i\f0\fs28 The Last Question\par
\pard\par
\pard\qj\tx204\i0\fs22 The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May\par
21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light.\par
The question came about as a result of a five-dollar bet over high-\par
balls, and it happened this way:\par
\pard\fi192\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx192\f1 Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face\emdash miles and miles of face\emdash of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.\f0\par
\f1 Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. \emdash So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac\rquote s.\f0\par
For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, \fs20 and \f1\fs22 Venus, but past that, Earth\rquote s poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.\f0\par
But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.\par
\pard\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx204 The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half\f1  \f0 the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sun\-power.\par
\pard\fi397\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx396 Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boss appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.\par
They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.\par
\f1 "It\rquote s amazing when you think of it,\rdblquote  said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. \ldblquote All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never \ul\f0 miss\ulnone\f1  the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, kind he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware. \ldblquote Not forever,\rdblquote  he said.\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote That\rquote s not forever.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Twenty billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. \ldblquote Twenty biffion years isn\rquote t forever.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\li386\qj\tx385\f1\ldblquote Well, it \i\f0 will \i0\f1 last our time, won\rquote t it?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote So would the coal and uranium.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi397\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx396\f2 "All right, \f1 but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can\rquote t do \i\f0 that \i0\f1 on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don\rquote t believe me.\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote I don\rquote t have to ask Multivac. I know that.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 "Then stop running down what Multivac\rquote s done for us,\rdblquote  said Adell, blazing up, \ldblquote It did all right.\rdblquote\par
\pard\fi408\sl-498\slmult0\tx408\cf1\ldblquote Who says it didn\rquote t? What I say is that a sun won\rquote t \f0 last \f1 forever. That\rquote s all I\rquote m \f2 saying. \f1 We\rquote re safe for twenty \f0 billion \f1 years; but then what\rquote  Lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. \f3\ldblquote And \f1 don\rquote t say we'll switch to another sun.\rdblquote\f0\par
There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov's eyes slowly \f2 closed. \f0 They rested d.\par
\f1 Then Lupov\rquote s \f0 eyes \f1 snapped open. \ldblquote You\rquote re thinking we\rquote ll switch itch to another sun when ours is done, aren\rquote t you?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\lquote Tm not thinking.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 "Sure you are. You\rquote re weak on logic, that\rquote s the trouble with you. You\rquote re like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who \f0 ran \f1 to a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn\rquote t worried, you see, because he ligured when one tree got wet through, he would just \f4 get \f0 under another one.\par
\f1\ldblquote I get it,\rdblquote  said Adell. \lquote Don\rquote t shout. When the sun is done, the other stars \f0 will \f1 be gone, too.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Darn \f0 right \f1 they will,\rdblquote  muttered Lupov. \ldblquote It all had a beginning in the \f0 original cosmic explosion, whLitever that was, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run \f1 dcwn faster than others. Hell, the giants won\rquote t last a hundred million years. The sun \f0 will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to max\-\f1 imum, that\rquote s all.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 "I know all about entropy,\rdblquote  said Adell, standing on \f0 his dignity.\par
\f1\ldblquote The hell you do.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote I know as much as you do.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Then you know everything\rquote s got to \f0 run \f1 down someday.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote All \f0 right. Who \f1 says they won\rquote t?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\lquote You did, you \f0 poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, \f1 forever. You said \lquote forever.\rquote\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 It was Adell\rquote s turn to be contrary. \ldblquote Maybe we \f0 can \f1 build things up again someday,\rdblquote  he said.\f0\par
\f1 "Never.\rdblquote\f0\par
"Why not? Someday.\par
\f1\ldblquote Ask Multivac.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Never.\rdblquote\f0\par
\i\f1\ldblquote You \i0\f0 ask Multivac. I dare you. Five \f1 dollars says it can\rquote t be done.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx204 Adell was just drunk enough to try, jut sober enough to be able\f1  \f5 to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age?\par
\pard\fi210\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx209 Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?\par
Multivac fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking relays ended.\par
Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: In\f0\-\b\f5 SUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\par
\pard\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx209\par
\pard\fi210\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx209\b0\ldblquote No bet,\rdblquote  whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly.\par
By next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten the incident.\par
\pard\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx209\par
\pard\fi210\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx209 Jerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble-disk, centered.\par
\ldblquote That\rquote s X-23,\rdblquote  said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.\par
The little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of inside-outness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother, screaming, \ldblquote We\rquote ve reached X-23-we\rquote ve reached X-23-we\rquote ve------\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote Quiet, children,\rdblquote  said Jerrodine sharply. \ldblquote Are you sure, Jer\f0\-\f5 rodd?\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote What is there to be but sure?\rdblquote  asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.\par
Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equa\f0\-\f5 tions for the hyperspacial jumps.\par
\pard\fi221\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx221\cf0\f0 Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the com\-fortable residence quarters of the ship.\par
\f1 Someone had once told Jerrodd that the \ldblquote ac\rdblquote  at the end of \ldblquote Microvac\rdblquote  stood for \ldblquote analog computer\rdblquote  in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.\f0\par
\f1 Jerrodine\rquote s eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. \ldblquote I can\rquote t help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Why, for Pete\rquote s sake?\rdblquote  demanded Jerrodd. \ldblquote We had nothing there. We\rquote ll have everything on X-23. You won\rquote t be alone. You won\rquote t be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great-grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded.\rdblquote  Then, after a re\f0\-\f1 flective pause, \ldblquote I tell you, it\rquote s a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\lquote I know, I know,\rdblquote  said Jerrodine miserably.\f0\par
\f1 Jerrodette 1 said promptly, \ldblquote Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote I think so, too,\rdblquote  said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.\f0\par
It \i was \i0\f1 a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father\rquote s youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once, came refinement. In place of transistors, had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only \f0 half the volume of a spaceship.\par
\f1 Jerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth\rquote s Planetary AC (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible.\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote So many stars, so many planets,\rdblquote  sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. \ldblquote I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Not forever,\rdblquote  said Jerrodd, with a smile. \ldblquote It will all stop some\f0\-\f1 day, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi397\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx396\f1\ldblquote What\rquote s entropy, daddy?\rdblquote  shrilled Jerrodette \b\f0 II.\par
\pard\fi210\sl-238\slmult0\tx209\b0\f1\ldblquote Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe. Everything runs down, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Can\rquote t you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote The stars \i\f0\fs20 are \i0\f1\fs22 the power-units, dear. Once they\rquote re gone, there are no more power-units.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Jerrodette I at once set up a howl. \ldblquote Don\rquote t let them, daddy. Don\rquote t let the stars run down.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Now look what you\rquote ve done,\rdblquote  whispered Jerrodine, exasperated. \ldblquote How was I to know it would frighten them?\rdblquote  Jerrodd whispered back.\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Ask the Microvac,\rdblquote  wailed Jerrodette I. \ldblquote Ask him bow to turn the stars on again.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Go ahead,\rdblquote  said Jerrodine. \ldblquote It wifi quiet them down.\rdblquote  (Jerro\f0\-dette II was beginning to cry, also).\par
\f1 Jerrodd shrugged. \ldblquote Now, now, honeys. \f6 I\rquote ll \f1 ask Microvac. Don\rquote t worry, he\rquote ll tell us.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 He asked the Microvac, adding quickly, \ldblquote Print the answer.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, \ldblquote See now, the Microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don\rquote t worry.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Jerrodine said, \ldblquote And now, children, it\rquote s time for bed. We\rquote ll be in our new home soon.\rdblquote\f0\par
Jerrodd read the words on the celluflim again before destroying\par
\pard\tx204 it: \b\fs16 INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\par
\par
\pard\fi210\sl-238\slmult0\tx209\b0\fs22 He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\tx209\par
\pard\fi210\sl-238\slmult0\tx209\f1 VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, \ldblquote Are we ridicu\f0\-\f1 lous, I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. \ldblquote I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion.\rdblquote\f0\par
Both seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed.\par
\f1\ldblquote Still,\rdblquote  said VJ-23X, \ldblquote I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote I wouldn\rquote t consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We\rquote ve got to stir them up.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi397\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx396\f1 VJ-23X sighed. \ldblquote Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More.\rdblquote\par
\pard\fi210\sl-249\slmult0\qj\tx209\b\ldblquote A hundred billion is \b0\i\f7\fs20 not \i0\f1\fs22 infinite and it\rquote s getting less infinite all the tune. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. it took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the populauon doubles every \f0\fs20 ten \f1\fs22 years-\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 VJ-23X interrupted. \ldblquote We can thank immortality for that.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Yet you wouldn\rquote t want to abandon life, I suppose.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Not at all,\rdblquote  snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, \ldblquote Not yet. I\rquote m by no means old enough. How old are you?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Two hundred twenty-three. And you?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote I\rquote m still under two hundred. -But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we\rquote ll have filled another in ten years. Another ten years and we\rquote ll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we\rquote ll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known Universe. Then what?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 VJ-23X said, \ldblquote As a side issue, there\rquote s a problem of transporta\f0\-tion. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Gal\-\f1 axies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Most of it\rquote s wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population. We\rquote ll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point. A very good point.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote We\rquote ll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Or out of dissipated heat?\rdblquote  asked MQ-171, sarcastically.\f0\par
\pard\fi397\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx396\f1\ldblquote There may be \b\f0 some way to reverse entropy. We ought to \b0 ask the Galactic \b\f1 AC.\rdblquote\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\f0 VJ-23X \b0 was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his AC-contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him.\par
\f1\ldblquote I\rquote ve half a mind to,\rdblquote  he said. \ldblquote It\rquote s something the human race will have to face someday.\rdblquote\f0\par
He stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself, but it was connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic AC that served all mankind. Hyperspace considered, it was an integral part of the Galactic AC.\par
MQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic AC. It was on a little world of its own, a spider webbing of force-beams holding the matter within which surges of sub-mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves. Yet despite its sub-etheric workings, the Galactic AC was known to be a full thousand feet across.\par
\f1 MQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact, \ldblquote Can entropy ever be reversed?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 VJ-23X looked startled and said at once, \ldblquote Oh, say, I didn\rquote t really mean to have you ask that.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Why not?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote We both know entropy can\rquote t be reversed. You can\rquote t turn smoke and ash back into a tree.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Do you have trees on your world?\rdblquote  asked MQ-17J.\f0\par
The sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said: \b\fs16 THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\b0\f1\fs22 VJ-23X said, \ldblquote See!\rdblquote\f0\par
The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council.\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\f1 Zee Prime\rquote s mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, each with its load of humanity. -But a load that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to be found out here, in space.\f0\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx204 Minds, not bodies! The immortal bodies remained back on the planets, in suspension over the eons. Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer. Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng,\f1  \f0 but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals.\par
\pard\fi216\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx215 Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.\par
\f1\ldblquote I am Zee Prime,\rdblquote  said Zee Prime. \ldblquote And you?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote We call it only the Galaxy. And you?\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote True. Since all Galaxies are the same.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Zee Prime said, \ldblquote On which one?\rdblquote\f0\par
\b\f1\ldblquote I \b0 cannot say. The Universal AC would know.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Zee Prime\rquote s perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrank and became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, aLl carrying their load of inteffigences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the original Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.\f0\par
\f1 Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and he called out: \ldblquote Universal AC! On which Galaxy did mankind origi\f0\-\f1 nate?\rdblquote\f0\par
The Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its receptors ready, and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal AC kept itself aloof.\par
Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal AC, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across, difficult to see.\par
\f1\ldblquote But how can that be all of Universal AC?\rdblquote  Zee Prime had asked.\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote Most of it,\rdblquote  had been the answer, \ldblquote is in hyperspace. In what form it is there I cannot imagine.\rdblquote\f0\par
Nor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any man had any part of the making of a Universal AC. Each Universal AC designed and constructed its successor.\par
\pard\sl-243\slmult0\tx204 Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.\par
The Universal AC interrupted Zee \f1 Prime\rquote s wandering thoughts, not with words, but \f0 with \f1 guidance. Zee Prune\rquote s mentality \f0 was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars.\par
A thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. \f1\fs16\ldblquote THIS IS \f7 THE \f0 ORIGINAL GALAXY \f1 OF MAN.\rdblquote\f0\par
\par
\fs22 But it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Zee Prime stifled his disappointment.\par
Dee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied \f1 the other, said suddenly, \ldblquote And is one of \f0 these stars the original \f1 star of Man?\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi204\sl-238\slmult0\tx204 The Universal AC said, \f1\fs16\ldblquote MAN\rquote S ORIGINAL STAR HAS GONE \f0 NOVA. IT IS A WHITE \f1 DWARF.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\tx204\par
\pard\fi210\sl-243\slmult0\tx209\f1\fs22\ldblquote Did \f0 the men upon it \f1 die?\rdblquote  asked Zee Prime, startled and \f0 without thinking.\par
\pard\fi204\sl-243\slmult0\tx204 The Universal AC said, \f1\fs16\ldblquote A \f0 NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR \f1 THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TIME.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-243\slmult0\tx204\par
\f1\fs22\ldblquote Yes, of course,\rdblquote  said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His \f0 mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.\par
\f1 Dee Sub Wun said, \ldblquote What is wrong?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote The stars \f0 are dying. The original star is \f1 dead.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote They must all die. Why not?\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote But when all energy is gone, our bodies will \f0 finally die, and you and I \f1 with them.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote It \f0 will \f1 take billions of years.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote I do not \f0 wish it to happen even after billions \f1 of years. Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?\rdblquote\f0\par
Dee Sub Wun said in amusement, \f1\ldblquote You\rquote re \f0 asking how entropy might \f1 be reversed in direction.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi204\sl-243\slmult0\tx204 And the Universal AC answered: \f1\fs16\ldblquote THERE \f0 IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A \f1 MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-243\slmult0\tx204\par
\pard\fi204\sl-249\slmult0\qj\tx204\f1\fs22 Zee Prime\rquote s thoughts \f0 fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a Galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee \f1 Prime\rquote s \f0 own. It \f1 didn\rquote t matter. \f0 Unhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built.\par
Man considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable.\par
\f1 Man said, \ldblquote The Universe is dying.\rdblquote\f0\par
Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.\par
New stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thou\-sand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too.\par
\f1 Man said, \ldblquote Carefully husbanded, as directed by the Cosmic AC, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\ldblquote But even so,\rdblquote  said Man, \ldblquote eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase forever to the maximum.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1 Man said, \ldblquote Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the Cosmic\f0\par
\pard\qj\tx204\f1 AC.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi204\sl-249\slmult0\qj\tx204 The Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a frag\-ment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of some\-thing that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and nature no longer had meaning in any terms that Man could comprehend.\par
\f1\ldblquote Cosmic AC,\rdblquote  said Man, \ldblquote how may entropy be reversed?\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi204\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx204 The Cosmic AC said, \b\f1\fs16\ldblquote THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A \b0\f0 MEANiNGFUL \b\f1 ANSWER.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-243\slmult0\qj\tx204\par
\pard\fi204\sl-249\slmult0\qj\tx204\b0\f1\fs22 Man said, \ldblquote Collect additional data.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\li204\qj\tx204 The Cosmic AC said, \b\f1\fs16\ldblquote I \b0\f0 WILL DO \fs22 SO. \fs16 I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A\par
\pard\qj\tx204\par
HUNDRED \b BILLION \b0 YEARS. MY \b PREDECESSORS AND I \b0 HAVE \b BEEN\par
\par
ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES. \b0 ALL THE \b DATA I HAVE \b0 REMAINS\par
\par
\pard\fi397\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx396\b\f1 INSUFFICIENT.\rdblquote\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\b0\fs22\ldblquote Will there come a time,\rdblquote  said Man, \ldblquote when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances?\rdblquote\f0\par
The Cosmic AC said, \b\f1\fs16\ldblquote NO PROBLEM IS \b0\f0 INSOLUBLE IN ALL \b CON\-\f1 CEIVABLE CLRCUMSTANCES.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\b0\f1\fs22 Man said, \ldblquote When will you have enough data to answer the question?\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi204\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx204 The Cosmic AC said, \b\f1\fs16\ldblquote THERE IS AS YET \b0\f0 INSUFFICIENT \b DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL \b0\f1 ANSWER.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx204\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\f1\fs22\ldblquote Will you kecp working on it?\rdblquote  asked Man.\f0\par
The Cosmic AC said, \b\f1\fs16\ldblquote i \b0 WILL.\rdblquote\f0\par
\f1\fs22 Man said, \ldblquote We shall wait.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198 The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of \fs20 running \fs22 down.\par
One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.\par
\f1 Man\rquote s last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.\f0\par
\f1 Man said, \ldblquote AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\fi204\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx204 AC said, \b\f1\fs16\ldblquote THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.\rdblquote\f0\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx204\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\b0\f1\fs22 Man\rquote s last mind fused and only AC existed-and that in hyper\f0\-space.\par
\pard\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198\par
\pard\fi199\sl-238\slmult0\qj\tx198 Matter and energy had ended and with it space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man.\par
All other questions had been answered, and until this last ques\-tion was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness.\par
All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.\par
But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.\par
\pard\fi397\sl-498\slmult0\qj\tx396 A timeless interval was spent in doing that.\par
\f1 And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.\par
But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter.\par
The answer ---- by demonstration---- would take care of that, too. For another timeless \par
interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program. \par
The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded\par
over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.\par
And AC said, "\b LET THERE BE LIGHT!"\par
\b0 And there was light ----\f0\fs36\par
